NCT03583983,The DNA-Based Lifestyle Enhancement Trial,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03583983,DNAble,COMPLETED,"Despite the known cardiovascular benefits of regular physical activity and having a balanced diet, it has proven challenging to change health behaviours towards favourable lifestyles. The overarching aim of the study is to test the effect of providing personalized genetic information along with diet and exercise plans on adherence to healthy lifestyle habits and cardio-metabolic risk. There is tremendous public interest in genetics and some evidence that providing genetic information can help improve health habits. However, no intervention to date has examined the effect of comprehensive genetic testing using cutting-edge polygenic score (PGS) prediction and an interactive health portal on health behaviours and cardio-metabolic risk. The investigators hypothesize that providing participants with detailed genetic information about genetic determinants of fitness and nutrition traits will help motivate people to adopt healthy lifestyle habits. The primary objective is to test the effect of providing genetic information and interactive recommendations for diet and exercise on adoption of healthy behaviours. The secondary objective is to evaluate the effects of the personalized health recommendations on cardio-metabolic risk markers, such as dyslipidemia, inflammatory markers, and fasting glucose.",NO,Health Behavior|Genetic Information|Cardiovascular Risk Factor,BEHAVIORAL: Personalized Health Recommendations|BEHAVIORAL: Generic Health Recommendations,"Change in Physical Activity Levels (Strength Training), Physical activity levels (strength training) will be defined by frequency of strength training per week. Strength training is one of the domains of physical activity recognized by the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines, which recommend at least two sessions of strength training per week. Accordingly, physical activity levels will be ascertained through the following survey question: ""In the last 3 months, how many times per week did you perform strength training?"" The minimum value for this outcome would be 0 and there is no theoretical maximum though we expect most values to be below 7 since 7 would represent strength training on a daily basis. Higher values indicate higher levels of physical activity and vice versa., Baseline and 3 months follow-up|Change in Physical Activity Levels (Aerobic Exercise), Physical activity levels (aerobic exercise) will be defined by frequency of aerobic exercise per week. Aerobic exercise is one of the domains of physical activity recognized by the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines, which recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week. Accordingly, physical activity levels will be ascertained through the following survey question: ""In the last 3 months, how many times per week did you perform aerobic exercises training?"" The minimum value for this outcome would be 0 and there is no theoretical maximum though we expect most values to be below 7 since 7 would represent aerobic exercise on a daily basis. Higher values indicate higher levels of physical activity and vice versa., Baseline and 3 months follow-up|Change in Dietary Healthiness, Dietary healthiness will be ascertained using the dietary risk score developed by the INTERHEART study which was found to explain 30% of the population attributable risk for acute myocardial infarction. Briefly, the dietary risk score takes into account consumption of meat, salty snacks, fried foods, fruits and vegetables. The point score ranges from 0 to 6 with higher scores indicating a less healthy diet., Baseline and 3 months follow-up","Change in Triglycerides, Serum Triglyceride Levels (mmol/L), Baseline and 3 months follow-up|Change in C-Reactive Protein, High Sensitivity Serum C-reactive protein Levels (mg/L), Baseline and 3 months follow-up|Change in Fasting Glucose, Serum Fasting Glucose Levels (mmol/L), Baseline and 3 months follow-up|Change in Blood Pressure, Blood Pressure (mmHg).

This score was developed by INTERHEART investigators and developed in the following paper: https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/32/5/581/426790. The score consolidates multiple established risk factors for heart disease in addition to physical activity and diet, including psychosocial stress, lipids, smoking status, diabetes etc. Higher scores indicate greater predicted risk of heart attack and lower scores indicate lower risk of heart attack. The score ranges from 0 to 32. A one point increase in the score is associated with a 12% increased risk of having a heart attack., Baseline and 3 months follow-up",,Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation,GeneBlueprint Corp|Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario)|GoodLife Fitness|Southlake Regional Health Centre,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,424,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION",20170928,2018-03-07,2018-12-30,2019-01-03,2018-07-12,,2019-03-06,"Hamilton Health Sciences (Juravinski Hospital, General Hospital, MUMC), Hamilton, Ontario, L8L2X2, Canada","Informed Consent Form, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/83/NCT03583983/ICF_000.pdf|Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/83/NCT03583983/Prot_SAP_002.pdf"
NCT04796532,Home Based or Traditional Class HIIT in Overweight Women.,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04796532,,UNKNOWN,"The present protocol aims to evaluate the effect of two different 16-week High-intensity interval training (HIIT) programs on daily physical activity, body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, eating behaviour, enjoyment and quality of life in overweight women. Methods: Ninety overweight women (25 - 50 years old) with a body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m2 will be randomly assigned to three groups of 30 participants: a remote home-based HIIT intervention group; a traditional HIIT intervention group; and a non-exercise control group. Both intervention groups will undergo a 16-week progressive HIIT program following the Tabata method. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 4th, 8th, and after 16-week for physical activity, body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, eating behaviour, enjoyment and quality of life. The study will have a 16-week follow-up post intervention. Results: The participant's enrolment will begin in December 2021, and investigators will anticipate the study completion by the mid of 2022. Conclusions: The HIIT programs might have beneficial effects on daily physical activity, body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness and overall quality of life in overweight women. Moreover, it might be a more enjoyable form of exercise, once it is performed faster than other exercise forms. As a beneficial side effect, these healthy behaviours might have a favourable impact on women's eating behaviours. This study results are expected to add health and well-being professionals' evidence-based knowledge to create strategies and design home-based exercise interventions.",NO,Overweight or Obesity,OTHER: Home based HIIT|OTHER: Traditional HIIT,"Change from Baseline, between and within groups comparison, in Physical activity., Objectively measured daily physical activity will be assessed through accelerometers., 0,4,8,16,32 weeks|Change from Baseline, between and within groups comparison, in Cardiorespiratory fitness., To assess VO2max the Chester Step Test will be used., 0,4,8,16,32 weeks|Change from Baseline, between and within groups comparison, in percentage of fat mass., It will be assessed % fat mass with a bioimpedance weighing machine electric model Tanita BC601., 0,4,8,16,32 weeks|Change from Baseline, between and within groups comparison, in bone mass., It will be assessed bone mass with a bioimpedance weighing machine electric model Tanita BC601.
