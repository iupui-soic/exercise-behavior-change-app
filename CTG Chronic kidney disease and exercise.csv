NCT03197038,Exercise Training and Cognitive Function in Kidney Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03197038,,COMPLETED,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD), affects over 45% of all individuals over 70 years of age. Patients with moderate CKD have more than a two-fold increased risk of cognitive impairment than those without CKD; furthermore, as many as 20-70% of patients with CKD have established cognitive impairment and overt dementia. The burden of cognitive impairment and dementia leads to functional decline and accelerated loss of independence, contributing to the tremendous individual, societal, and economic burden of CKD (i.e., 20% of Medicare expenditures in adults \>65 years of age). There is no recommended treatment to prevent cognitive decline in CKD patients, and the few medications available for cognitive impairment have only short term modest effects. There is a critical need to evaluate therapies to forestall cognitive impairment, and maintain or improve cognitive functioning in older patients with CKD. To address this need, this study will test the hypothesis that older patients with moderate/severe CKD and pre-clinical cognitive impairment randomized to a 6-month home-based exercise program will improve cognitive function and MRI measured brain structure, compared to a usual care control group. This study will combine an assessment of cognition with MR imaging techniques to fully evaluate brain structure, blood flow, and behavior relationships at a level previously not conducted in this population",YES,"Cognitive Function, Preclinical|Chronic Kidney Diseases|Older Adults",BEHAVIORAL: Partially supervised home-based walking exercise|BEHAVIORAL: Control,"Composite Global Cognitive Function, Determine the effect of a 6-month home-based exercise program on composite global cognitive functioning as determined by principal component analysis of immediate free recall of trials 1-5 on California verbal learning II, long-delay free recall and recognition, and memory discriminability, trail making test part A and part B, digit symbol substitution test, semantic and phonemic fluency, and Digit span subtest in older patients with kidney disease and preclinical cognitive impairment. A composite global cognitive score was created by converting the individual cognitive scores to standardized z scores and then averaging the standardized z scores. An increase in change from baseline to 6 months is considered an improvement., Change from baseline in composite global cognitive function at 6 months|Composite Executive Function, A composite executive functioning score was created by converting 4 individual executive cognitive scores (verbal fluency FAS and animal summary score, digit span backward subtest, and TMT-B) to standardized z scores and then averaging the standardized z scores. A larger change in Z score is considered an improvement., Change from baseline in composite executive function at 6 months","White Matter Integrity, Whole brain white matter integrity was created by averaging the fractional anisotropy of 80 tracts using region of interest analysis. An increased change from baseline to 6 months in fractional anisotropy (a measure of directionality, 0 = no principle direction, 1 = one principle direction) is considered an improvement., Change from baseline white matter integrity fractional anisotropy at 6 months|Hippocampal Volume - Right, Determine the effect of a 6-month exercise program on hippocampal volume. An increased change from baseline to 6 months in right hippocampal volume in cubic millimeters is considered an improvement., Change from baseline hippocampal volume at 6 months.|Cerebral Blood Flow, Determine the effect of a 6-month exercise program on cerebral blood flow.

An larger change is considered an improvement., Change from baseline in cerebral blood flow at 6 months.|Vascular Health - Young's Elastic Modulus, Vascular health was assessed by Young's Elastic Modulus (YEM) at the carotid artery. A larger negative change in YEM (measured in kilo pascal, stiffer artery=higher number) from baseline to 6 months is considered an improvement., Change from baseline in vascular health indices at 6 months|Cognitive Function - Total Cognition, Determine the effect of a 6-month exercise program on cognitive function via the NIH toolbox

This composite includes: Flanker, Dimensional Change Card Sort, Picture Sequence Memory, List Sorting and Pattern Comparison. This composite score is derived by averaging the standard scores of each of the measures, and then deriving standard scores based on this new distribution. An Age-Corrected Standard Score was used.
