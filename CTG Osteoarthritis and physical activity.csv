NCT03406767,A Comparison Between GLA:D Canada and an Individualized JointEffort Exercise Program in Knee Osteoarthritis Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03406767,,COMPLETED,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide and affects more than 4.4 million people in Canada (13% of Canadians). OA symptoms include joint pain, stiffness, range of motion loss, and inflammation, resulting in a significant decrease in quality of life. Current evidence-based guidelines for OA management recommend weight loss, patient education, exercise therapy, bracing, viscosupplementation, and anti-inflammatory/pain medications prior to joint replacement surgery. Unfortunately, current practice trends are not consistent with these guidelines and focus largely on joint replacement. Recently, research from a group in Denmark has shown a reduction in the progression of knee OA symptoms, joint related painkiller use, individuals on sick leave, and higher physical activity levels 12 months after a combined patient education and standardized group exercise therapy program (GLA:D®). Based on the Danish success, the GLA:D® program has been made available in Canada. To date it is unclear if the GLA:DTM Canada program will result in outcomes similar to those seen in Denmark, or how the GLA:DTM program compares to existing individualized OA care programs (i.e. JointEffort). This research will answer the following three questions;

1. Is the GLA:DTM standardized education and exercise program associated with improvements in functional mobility, quality of life, pain management, and inflammatory biomarkers in knee OA patients in Calgary, Alberta?
2. Is the JointEffort individualized exercise and education program associated with improved functional mobility, quality of life, pain management, and inflammatory biomarkers in knee OA patients in Calgary, Alberta?

Supporters of TKA suggest that this treatment gives a more predictable and better result, whereas supporters of UKA suggest that it is unnecessary to remove decent and functional cartilage in other compartments, and also that generally the UKA gives better results under certain circumstances. If the UKA is worn out or loosens, revision surgery will be relatively easy, whereas revision-surgery after a TKA can be much more problematic.

Also, it is of great interest to measure the direct costs of these treatments. Both general hospital costs, but also costs in societal in terms of sick-days, pain-killer expenditure, and physiotherapy.

A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale (scoring instructions are available in a separate document: KOOS Scoring). The five individual KOOS subscale scores are then given as secondary outcomes to enable clinical interpretation. The results of the 5 subscales can be plotted as an outcome profile (order of subscales from left to right: Pain, Symptoms, ADL, Sport/Rec and QOL), preferably in a graph with scores from 0-100 on the y-axis and the five subscales on the x-axis., 20 years|Forgotten Joint Score, questionnaire.

This mean value is subsequently multiplied by 25 to obtain a total score range of 0 to 100. Finally, the score is subtracted from 100 to change the direction of the final score in such a way that high scores indicate a high degree of ""forgetting"" the artificial joint-i.e. a low degree of awareness.

The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability. To calculate the scores it is necessary to purchase special software. Pricing depends on the number of scores that the researcher needs to calculate.

The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.

The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'.

For example, degenerative musculoskeletal disorders such as osteoarthritis (OA) present a grand challenge with its high prevalence (\>40% in the elderly suffered from knee OA). OA is a debilitating progressive disease with typical symptoms such as acute pain causing loss of mobility Currently there is no cure for OA. Pharmacological treatment and new regenerative technologies such as stem cell therapy are actively being developed, but most of these options are very expensive per se, and side effects are not uncommon. Costeffectiveness is also a major consideration for devising new therapeutic modalities for OA.

There are emerging evidences showing that pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) can modulae mitochondrial activities for muscle gain. PEMF exposure on top of regular exercise training may promote muscle regeneration and tissue healing.

This study aims to conduct a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of PEMF treatment on knee pain in patients with knee OA. We hypothesize that PEMF treatment is effective to relief in pain and improve knee function in Knee OA subjects.

Based on the aim of this study, older adult patients (aged 50 or above) with knee OA with Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2-4 by X-ray, have sedentary lifestyle (Tegner activity level less or equal to 3), no acute knee injuries in past 12 months, no muscle strain in past 12 months and not degenerative joint disease in other joints except the involved knee.

NCT02900781,Comparative Effectiveness of an Activity-specific Monitoring Device- StepRite,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02900781,,TERMINATED,"Partial or Total Knee Arthroplasty are procedures commonly used in severe degeneration of the knee joint due to osteoarthritis. With an increasing number of Partial or Total Knee Arthroplasty performed in a population that is aging during a time where the amount of healthcare dollars allotted to rehabilitation is declining, there is a need to develop remote monitoring of rehabilitation and to engage and optimize self-management of recovery.

Current management of Partial or Total Knee Arthroplasty recovery is typically performed in the out-patient setting and is highly protocol driven. A typical case might be seen by the physical therapist 2-3x/week for 8-10 weeks to perform specific exercises and to monitor progress (i.e. compliance with ROM and strengthening exercises). One recent study suggested that variation in patients' independent exercise and activity after arthroplasty surgery may contribute to variable functional gains.

NCT03776981,Core Activation and Stabilization for Knee OA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03776981,,COMPLETED,"This will be the second investigation by the PI and sub-investigator on this topic, following the promising results of a pilot study on a small sample size (N=5) completed last year. Whether or not core stabilization influences gait impairments in patients with KOA remains to be seen. Core stabilization has been shown to have positive effects, including increased stride velocity and scores on functional tests like the Functional Reach Test and Timed Up and Go, in older adults. Older adults were also shown to have high compliance with a core stability training program. A systematic review indicated that core training is important to consider when treating older individuals to improve functional use of the extremities, improving participation in activities of daily living, and as part of a fall prevention program. Additionally, it has been shown to benefit young, active individuals in preventing anterior cruciate ligament injury and greater duration of improved outcomes in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome. Athletes with decreased core control have been shown to be at an increased risk of knee injury as well. One potential cause for this is the ability of the core to improve lower extremity kinematics when activated during challenging single leg weight bearing activity. A recent publication by Azuma, et al. did indicate that paraspinal and anterior abdominal thinning had a negative predictive relationship to the presence of KOA; however, no investigation has explored a cause and effect relationship between core stability/stabilization training and the presence or severity of KOA, nor the gait and functional ability of patients with KOA.
