NCT03839953,Exercise Rehabilitation for Patients With Critical Limb Ischemia After Revascularization,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03839953,,UNKNOWN,"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects more than 200 million people worldwide. This disease occurs with narrowing and occlusion of arteries supplying oxygenated blood to the organs and limbs. Symptomatic patients typically experience leg pain with physical activity. More advanced disease states are referred to as critical limb ischemia (CLI), where patients may have leg pain at rest or non-healing wounds. Primary treatment of PAD involves risk factor management; smoking cessation, management of blood pressure, blood cholesterol, diabetes, and exercise prescription. Patients with CLI typically require interventions to reestablish blood supply to their limbs. There is currently minimal understanding of the role for exercise rehabilitation after revascularization procedures in this vulnerable population. This is the first clinical to understand the role of exercise for these patients. We hypothesize that exercise rehabilitation after revascularization will improve quality of life and functional capacity in these patients.",NO,Peripheral Arterial Disease|Critical Limb Ischemia,BEHAVIORAL: Supervised Exercise Program|OTHER: Best Medical Therapy,"Rate of enrollment, A minimum of 3 patients per month should be enrolled, 3 months|Functional Capacity, Functional capacity will be evaluated by a six-minute walk test, Three months|Quality of Life assessed by VascuQuol questionnaire, Questionnaire with 25 items validated for patients with peripheral arterial disease, Three months|Health status assess by SF-36, 36-item self-reported survey that provides a measure of patient health, Three months|Barriers or experiences with physical activity, We will conduct a 30-minute interview to gain better understanding of patient experiences with exercise rehabilitation., Three months","Major adverse limb events (MALE), Clinical deterioration or condition requiring surgical interventions, Five years",,University of Calgary,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,64,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,REB17-730,2019-02-15,2020-01-01,2020-07-01,2019-02-15,,2019-05-28,"Peter Lougheed Center, Alberta Health Services, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, T1Y 6J4, Canada","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/53/NCT03839953/Prot_SAP_000.pdf|Informed Consent Form, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/53/NCT03839953/ICF_001.pdf"
NCT05710653,Inter-individual Physiological Response to a Training and Detraining Period in Cardiometabolic Risk Factors Subjects,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05710653,VASCU-HEALTH,RECRUITING,"Background: Although exercise training is a well described therapy for some cardiometabolic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension, and metabolic syndrome, there is scarcity of knowledge about the post-exercise period term as 'detraining' where usually all physiological adaptations as cardiovascular and metabolic benefits are lost due to physical inactivity. Likewise, as some exercise training modalities as high-intensity interval training improve vascular parameters including endothelial dysfunction parameters as flow-mediated dilation (FMD%), and carotid-intima media thickness (c-IMT) during the 'training' period, there is little knowledge about how many 'volume' or 'intensity' of exercise training or physical activity per week is needed to maintain the exercise training benefits in populations with cardiometabolic risk factors such as those patients with arterial hypertension. This information will be of great interest for both improving and maintaining the vascular profile and health of Chilean adults with risk factors and to maintain a better vascular profile. Objective: To study the beneficial adaptations from the 'training' and 'detraining' period of exercise training on functional and structural vascular parameters in healthy and cardiometabolic risk factors adult subjects to improve the health profile. Methods: The investigators will conduct an experimental design of 5 groups of exercise training in healthy (controls) and hypertensive (HTN) patients (≥140 mmHg), with overweight/or obesity, men and women, with BMI ≥25 and ≤35 kg/m2, aged ≥18y, physically inactive (\<150 min/week of low/moderate PA/week, or \<75 min/week of vigorous PA) in the last 6 months will be invited for participating. The groups will be as follows; Group (HTNex will be compared with Group HTNcg). Group (ELEex will be compared with Group ELEcg). Group (NTex will be compared with Group NTcg). Each group will be compared in their physiological vascular adaptations before and after exercise training such as HIIT, and after 3 months of a detraining period. Results (hypothesis): The investigators hypothesized that the maintenance of vascular outcomes after the 'detraining' period is intensity-dependent in adults with HTN that participated of an exercise
