NCT04621045,Active You: Feasibility of a Unique Physical Activity Program to Prevent Diabetes and Heart Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04621045,,COMPLETED,"Individuals who are overweight/obese are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes (T2D). Current evidence suggests that PA, even without dietary prescription, can be efficacious in preventing T2D. Yet most Americans, especially those who are overweight/obese, are not physically active. Socioenvironmental barriers to physical activity (PA) such as body image concerns and limited access to fitness facilities contribute to the low levels of PA observed in overweight/obese adults. Web-based PA programs have been developed to address these barriers, but the outcomes have been marginal. Qualitative studies suggest that individuals who are overweight/obese prefer PA programs that feature people they can relate to especially in body size, fitness status and age. Previously, the investigators have included these preferences in a technology-based Physical Activity for The Heart (PATH) intervention that leverages open source platforms, such as YouTube, to promote PA in any setting. In this application, the investigators propose to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of PATH in promoting PA and reducing cardiometabolic risk in adults who are overweight/obese and at high risk of diabetes. In Aim 1 the investigators will conduct a 12-week randomized clinical trial including 52 adults who are overweight/obese and at high risk of diabetes to assess the feasibility and acceptability of PATH. In Aim 2 investigators will examine the trend in PA and cardiometabolic risk change from baseline to post-intervention. This approach is innovative because it leverages open source technologies to provide low-cost, action-oriented PA resources that match the preferences of adults who are overweight/obese.

NCT06022588,Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia Breath Testing,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06022588,,COMPLETED,"Background and aims:

A gold standard diagnostic test to diagnose chronic mesenteric ischemia is currently lacking. Isotope labelled-butyrate and glucose breath testing could theoretically quantify mucosal oxygen consumption and thereby detect ischemia, since oxygen is needed to absorb and metabolize butyrate and glucose, and distinguish aerobic/anaerobic intestinal epithelial metabolism. Here we aim to test this notion and compare results to conventional biomarkers.

Methods:

Healthy volunteers were randomized into two control groups and two intervention groups, each consisting of five volunteers receiving either oral 13C -butyrate or 13C -glucose. The control groups performed breath tests without any physical exercise. The intervention groups performed a 30 minutes standardized bicycle exercise test, which has been proven to elicit mesenteric ischemia. Breath samples of expired 13CO2 were collected during a period of 4 hours and results were contrasted to measurements of biomarkers in peripheral blood.",NO,Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia,"DRUG: Sodium butyrate, 1-13C, 99%, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.USA|DRUG: U-13C6, 99%; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.USA|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Breath test|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Exercise + breath test","The median concentrations of measured 13CO2, The median concentrations of measured 13CO2 at each time point where compared within the four groups and statistically tested with a Mann - Whitney U test., At the following time points; baseline, 0.5, 1, 1.25 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 3, 3.5 and 4 hours (total of 12 time points) after ingestion of 13C-butyrate or 13C-glucose.",,,Erasmus Medical Center,,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,20,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: DIAGNOSTIC,NL72878.078.20,2021-03-01,2021-04-01,2021-08-01,2023-09-05,,2023-09-05,"Erasmus Medical Center - Department of Gastroenterology, Rotterdam, Netherlands","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/88/NCT06022588/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"

NCT05895916,Extreme Exercise and Energy Expenditure (4E) Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05895916,,COMPLETED,"The goal of this clinical trial is to provide evidence, through an extreme exercise prescription (1,144 km of road cycling on seven consecutive days), that weight loss is not the appropriate outcome to evaluate the effects of exercise on abdominal adiposity and ectopic fat depots (e.g. liver fat and epi/pericardial fat) in eleven recreational middle-aged male cyclists (aged 50 to 66 years) without symptoms of cardiovascular disease. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* If energy intake is substantially increased to compensate energy expenditure and prevent weight loss following an extreme exercise prescription, will significant changes in body composition and body fat distribution be observed?
* Will these changes translate into improvements in the cardiometabolic health profile even in the absence of weight loss?

Participants will be asked to partake in several evaluations: fasting plasma lipoprotein-lipid profile and inflammation markers, glycated hemoglobin, cardiorespiratory fitness, submaximal exercise test including measurement of energy expenditure, resting and exercise blood pressure and heart rate, evaluation of regional adiposity, liver fat content, epi/pericardial fat, nutritional quality, and level of physical activity. After baseline evaluations, participants will be asked to alternately bike 208 km and 104 km per day on a pre-specified course for seven consecutive days. They will be accompanied during each of the seven bike rides by research professionals in a recreational vehicle. Participants' weight, body composition and waist circumference will be measured under standardized conditions in the morning after an overnight fast and after the exercise. Their heart rate will be continuously monitored, and participants will wear accelerometers to estimate their daily exercise-related energy expenditure. Foods and fluids will be provided to participants and recorded. At the end of the 1,144 km/ 7-days bike ride, baseline evaluations will be repeated with the exception of the maximal exercise treadmill test, nutritional quality, and level of physical activity.

NCT05710653,Inter-individual Physiological Response to a Training and Detraining Period in Cardiometabolic Risk Factors Subjects,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05710653,VASCU-HEALTH,RECRUITING,"Background: Although exercise training is a well described therapy for some cardiometabolic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension, and metabolic syndrome, there is scarcity of knowledge about the post-exercise period term as 'detraining' where usually all physiological adaptations as cardiovascular and metabolic benefits are lost due to physical inactivity. Likewise, as some exercise training modalities as high-intensity interval training improve vascular parameters including endothelial dysfunction parameters as flow-mediated dilation (FMD%), and carotid-intima media thickness (c-IMT) during the 'training' period, there is little knowledge about how many 'volume' or 'intensity' of exercise training or physical activity per week is needed to maintain the exercise training benefits in populations with cardiometabolic risk factors such as those patients with arterial hypertension. This information will be of great interest for both improving and maintaining the vascular profile and health of Chilean adults with risk factors and to maintain a better vascular profile. Objective: To study the beneficial adaptations from the 'training' and 'detraining' period of exercise training on functional and structural vascular parameters in healthy and cardiometabolic risk factors adult subjects to improve the health profile. Methods: The investigators will conduct an experimental design of 5 groups of exercise training in healthy (controls) and hypertensive (HTN) patients (≥140 mmHg), with overweight/or obesity, men and women, with BMI ≥25 and ≤35 kg/m2, aged ≥18y, physically inactive (\<150 min/week of low/moderate PA/week, or \<75 min/week of vigorous PA) in the last 6 months will be invited for participating. The groups will be as follows; Group (HTNex will be compared with Group HTNcg). Group (ELEex will be compared with Group ELEcg). Group (NTex will be compared with Group NTcg). Each group will be compared in their physiological vascular adaptations before and after exercise training such as HIIT, and after 3 months of a detraining period.

NCT04437251,Effect of Brain Stimulation on Stepping Performance in Stroke Survivors and Healthy Adults,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04437251,Gait,RECRUITING,"Participants are being asked to participate in a research study conducted by Shih-Chiao Tseng, PT, Ph.D. at Texas Woman's University. This research study is to determine whether low-intensive brain stimulation can enhance learning of a leg movement task. The investigators also want to know if brain stimulation can improve the nerve function and walking performance. Our goal is to understand any relationship between brain stimulation and overall movement control improvement. Participants have been invited to join this research if they have had a stroke before or they are healthy adults aged 21 years or older. Research evidence shows stroke can induce permanent brain damage and therefore may cause a person to have trouble learning a new task. This in turn may significantly impact the recovery of motor function in stroke survivors. In addition, the investigators also want to know how a healthy person learns this new leg task and see if her/his learning pattern differs from a stroke survivor.

This study comprises two phases: Phase I study investigates short-term effects of brain stimulation on leg skill learning and only requires two visits to TWU. The total time commitment for Phase I study will be about 6.5 hours, 3.5 hours on the first visit and three hours on the second visit; Phase II study is an expanded version of Phase I study to investigate long-term effects of brain stimulation on leg skill learning and requires to complete 12 visits of exercise training paired with brain stimulation over a four-week period and additional one visit for follow-up test. The total time commitment for Phase II study will be about 20 hours, a total of 18 hours for 12 exercise training sessions and two hours for a follow-up test. The investigators hypothesize that people with chronic stroke will show a slower rate of acquiring this leg skill as compared to healthy adults. The investigators also hypothesize that co-applying brain stimulation with 12 sessions of exercise training will enhance skill learning of this leg task for people with chronic stroke and this 12-session exercise program may exert beneficial influences on the nerve function and leg muscle activation, and consequentially improve motor control for walking.",NO,"Vascular Accident, Brain|CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident)|Gait, Hemiplegic|Spastic Lower Extremity Weakness",DEVICE: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS),"Changes in stepping reaction time (Phase I), Calculate the time duration for the central nervous system to process information and produce a stepping action., Measure changes in the reaction time before, immediately after (i.e. within a minute), and 30 minutes after a single session of brain stimulation.|Changes in stepping reaction time (Phase II), Calculate the time duration for the central nervous system to process information and produce a stepping action., Measure changes in reaction time before training, up to 24 hours after the completion of a 12-session training program, and one week after the completion of a 12-session training program.|Changes in walking performance (Phase I), Measure walking speed (meters/second) during ground walking at a self-selected speed., Measure changes in the walking speed before, immediately after (i.e. within a minute), and 30 minutes after a single session of brain stimulation.|Changes in walking performance (Phase I), Measure step length (centimeters) symmetry (left/right) during ground walking at a self-selected speed., Measure changes in the step length symmetry before, immediately after (i.e. within a minute), and 30 minutes after a single session of brain stimulation.|Changes in walking performance (Phase II), Measure walking speed (meters/second) during ground walking at a self-selected speed., Measure changes in the walking speed before training, up to 24 hours after the completion of a 12-session training program, and one week after the completion of a 12-session training program.|Changes in walking performance (Phase II), Measure step length symmetry (left/right) during ground walking at a self-selected speed., Measure changes in the step length symmetry before training, up to 24 hours after the completion of a 12-session training program, and one week after the completion of a 12-session training program.|Changes in nerve function (Phase I), Place a surface electrode on the calf muscle to record muscle activation triggered by electrical stimulation delivered to the motor neurons in the lesioned motor cortex and tibial nerve on the paretic leg to qualify changes in neuronal activity in the primary cortex and in the spinal cord before and after brain stimulation (tDCS)., Measure changes in the nerve function before, immediately after (i.e. within a minute), and 30 minutes after a single session of brain stimulation.|Changes in nerve function (Phase II), Place a surface electrode on the calf muscle to record muscle activation triggered by electrical stimulation delivered to the motor neurons in the lesioned motor cortex and tibial nerve on the paretic leg to qualify changes in neuronal activity in the primary cortex and in the spinal cord before and after brain stimulation (tDCS)., Measure changes in the nerve function before training, up to 24 hours after the completion of a 12-session training program), and one week after the completion of a 12-session training program.","Mini-mental State Examination (Phase I), A standardized questionnaires to evaluate the cognitive function consisting of 11 items with a possible summed score ranging from zero to 30.

NCT04280783,Active You: A Novel Exercise Program for African Americans,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04280783,,COMPLETED,"Barriers to physical activity (PA) among African Americans (AAs) have been extensively studied, yet there is a paucity of innovative PA interventions designed to address them. In recent years, many studies have used the internet to promote PA in many settings, including the home environment, but only a few studies have recruited AAs. Without innovative and culturally relevant interventions, AAs will continue reporting extremely low levels of PA and disparate cardiovascular health outcomes. In prior work, the investigators sought the input of AA focus groups to inform the development of a technology-based Physical Activity for The Heart (PATH) intervention that leverages openly accessible platforms, such as YouTube, to promote PA in any setting. The investigators designed PATH as a culturally salient action-oriented intervention that can be accessed in any setting to promote PA among inactive AAs. In this application, the investigators propose to examine whether PATH is a feasible strategy for promoting PA among inactive AAs. In Aim 1 the investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial that will include 30 inactive AAs to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the PATH intervention. In Aim 2 the investigators will examine the trend in PA and cardiovascular disease risk change from baseline to post-intervention. This approach is innovative because it leverages openly accessible technologies to provide a wide variety of free, enjoyable and action-oriented workout videos that match AAs preferences.

Ischemic Conditioning (IC) is a non-invasive, simple procedure that improves motor function, exercise performance and cardiovascular function in healthy controls, but it has never been applied to the stroke population. We postulate that IC enhances the recruitment of motoneurons and results in positive neural adaptations, improves vascular endothelial function and peripheral blood flow, and together these improvements result in an increased capacity to exercise and faster walking speed.

Mechanisms involved in the regulation of plasma volume, such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and renal dopamine (DA), may be impaired in POTS and may respond inappropriately to changes in dietary sodium. The investigators propose that the changes in urinary sodium and dopamine excretion caused by consuming low-sodium and high-sodium diets will be different between patients with POTS and healthy volunteers. The purpose of this study is to determine (1) whether changes in dietary sodium level appropriately influence sodium excretion in POTS; (2) whether changes in dietary sodium level appropriately influence DA excretion in POTS; (3) whether a high dietary sodium level appropriately expands plasma volume in POTS; and (4) whether patients with POTS have improvements in their orthostatic tachycardia and symptoms as a result of a high dietary sodium level.",YES,Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome,RADIATION: Plasma Volume|PROCEDURE: Exercise Capacity Test - Bicycle|PROCEDURE: Posture Study,"24hr Urinary Sodium, Amount of sodium excreted in urine over 24hr ending on Day 7, Day 6 am - Day 7 am for each dietary sodium level|24hr Urinary Dopamine, Amount of dopamine excreted in urine over 24 hours ending on Day 7, Between Day 6 am - Day 7 am of each dietary sodium level","Plasma Volume, Plasma volume (PV) was determined by the indicator tracer-dilution technique, using the DAXOR Blood Volume Analyzer (BVA)-100 system (DAXOR Corporation), on Day 7 of the low sodium and high sodium dietary interventions., after 7 days of each dietary sodium level|Magnitude of Orthostatic Tachycardia, Whether the magnitude of the heart rate increase that occurs in patients with POTS when moving from a supine to an upright position is attenuated by a High Sodium diet relative to a Low Sodium diet.

Heart rate was then measured at intervals after subjects had been standing for up to 30 minutes (as tolerated). Differences between supine and standing values are presented for 5 minutes standing (or maximal stand if \<5 minutes) since several patients were unable to stand for 10 minutes.

Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an established technique for assessing changes in vascular permeability and interstitial water volume. The aim of this study is to establish the potential utility of DCE-MRI as a novel endpoint for dose ranging and proof of mechanism studies of TRPV4 blockers. The DCE-MRI markers of vascular permeability and pulmonary oedema will be measured in subjects with HF (group 2) and healthy volunteers (HV) (group 1) at rest to determine if there is a difference between the two populations. Apart from this, exercise induced changes relative to rest in interstitial volume and exchange rate will be evaluated in both HV and subjects with HF. Additionally, the capability of DCE-MRI to detect changes in interstitial lung fluid in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) (group 3) will be investigated. DCE-MRI markers of pulmonary oedema will be assessed when patients are initially hospitalized with ADHF and subsequently after receiving standard of care treatment to determine whether differences can be detected by this methodology.This study will enrol a sufficient number of subjects to have at least 24 subjects in Group 1 and 2 (group 1:12 HV and group 2: 12 subjects with HF) and atleast 5 subjects in Group 3. For each subject, the MRI data must be of sufficient quality to enable DCE-MRI modelling from 2 Sessions. For group 1 and 2, the subjects will have screening visit and 3 MRI sessions. For the first scanning session, subjects will undergo the baseline procedure. The second imaging session will occur approximately one week later to measure within subject variability. A third imaging session (which will be conducted in 2 visits) will incorporate a bicycle exercise challenge prior to the MRI scan, and this third scan will be performed approximately one to three days after the second imaging session. For group 3: Screening will occur during hospitalization for eligibility. Session 1of MRI will be conducted while the subject is still hospitalized. Session 2 will be conducted within 4 weeks of the first scan, when the signs of pulmonary oedema are considered to be resolved.

The ovarian hormone estrogen is important for supporting normal cognitive function, and changes in brain activity and function occur when estrogen levels are decreased. Estrogen is also important for maintaining healthy blood vessels which also support normal cognitive function. In Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, there is significant damage to the blood vessels in the brain. This study will test whether changes in brain activity and function with the loss of estrogen are related to changes in vascular function. The investigators will measure vascular function using ultrasound, and brain activity using MRI scans in women who are enrolled in the Females, Aging, Metabolism and Exercise (FAME) study (NCT01712230).

This project will address these important knowledge gaps by exposing healthy young and older adults to a prolonged (9 hour) heat exposure, with conditions representative of heatwaves in temperate continental climates. An additional cohort of older adults will complete the same heatwave simulation but will be briefly (2 hours) exposed to cooler conditions (22-23°C) mid-way through the session (akin to visiting a cooling centre or cooled location). The investigators will evaluate age-related differences in the capacity to dissipate heat via direct air calorimetry (a unique device that permits the precise measurement of the heat dissipated by the human body) and their effect on the regulation of body temperature. The investigators anticipate that older adults will exhibit progressive increases in the heat stored in the body throughout the simulated heatwave, resulting in progressive increases in body core temperature. Further, older adults exposed to brief-mid day cooling will rapidly gain heat upon re-exposure to high ambient temperatures. As a result, by the end of exposure body temperatures will be similar to the group not removed from the heat.",NO,Aging|Heat Stress|Physiological Stress,OTHER: Simulated heatwave exposure|OTHER: Simulated heatwave exposure with mid-day cooling,"Body heat storage, Cumulative amount of heat stored within the body, First 3 hours (hours 1-3) of simulated heatwave|Body heat storage, Cumulative amount of heat stored within the body, Final 3 hours (hours 7-9) of simulated heatwave|Rectal temperature, Index of core body temperature, Hour 3 of simulated heatwave|Rectal temperature, Index of core body temperature, Hour 9 of simulated heatwave","Heart rate, Measured continuously throughout exposure, Hour 3 of simulated heatwave|Heart rate, Measured continuously throughout exposure, Hour 9 of simulated heatwave|Systolic blood pressure, Arterial blood pressures measured via manual auscultation, Hour 3 of simulated heatwave|Systolic blood pressure, Arterial blood pressures measured via manual auscultation, Hour 9 of simulated heatwave|Diastolic blood pressure, Arterial blood pressures measured via manual auscultation, Hour 3 of simulated heatwave|Diastolic blood pressure, Arterial blood pressures measured via manual auscultation, Hour 9 of simulated heatwave|Mean arterial pressure, calculated as 1/3 \* systolic blood pressure + 2/3 diastolic blood pressure, Hour 3 of simulated heatwave|Mean arterial pressure, calculated as 1/3 \* systolic blood pressure + 2/3 diastolic blood pressure, Hour 9 of simulated heatwave|Rate pressure product, Calculated as systolic blood pressure \* heart rate, Hour 3 of simulated heatwave|Rate pressure product, Calculated as systolic blood pressure \* heart rate, Hour 9 of simulated heatwave|Cardiac baroreflex sensitivity, Determined from beat-to-beat arterial pressures and heart rate (volume-clamp technique), Hour 3 of simulated heatwave|Cardiac baroreflex sensitivity, Determined from beat-to-beat arterial pressures and heart rate (volume-clamp technique), Hour 9 of simulated heatwave|Change in plasma volume, Determined from venous blood samples, Hour 9 of simulated heatwave|Heart rate variability: SDNN, Standard deviation of successive normal R-R intervals, Hour 3 of simulated heatwave|Heart rate variability: SDNN, Standard deviation of successive normal R-R intervals, Hour 9 of simulated heatwave|Heart rate variability: RMSSD, Root mean squared standard deviation of successive normal R-R intervals, Hour 3 of simulated heatwave|Heart rate variability: RMSSD, Root mean squared standard deviation of successive normal R-R intervals, Hour 9 of simulated heatwave|Circulating inflammatory and stress markers, Tumor necrosis factor alpha, Interleukin 6, C-reactive protein, Hour 9 of simulated heatwave|Intracellular inflammatory and stress markers, Tumor necrosis factor alpha, Interleukin 6, Heat shock proteins 70 and 90, Hour 9 of simulated heatwave",,University of Ottawa,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,60,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,H 05-16-07,2019-01-01,2021-04-02,2021-04-02,2020-04-20,,2021-08-18,"University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, K1N6N5, Canada","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/76/NCT04353076/Prot_SAP_001.pdf"
