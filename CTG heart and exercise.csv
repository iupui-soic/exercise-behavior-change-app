NCT04621045,Active You: Feasibility of a Unique Physical Activity Program to Prevent Diabetes and Heart Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04621045,,COMPLETED,"Individuals who are overweight/obese are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes (T2D). Current evidence suggests that PA, even without dietary prescription, can be efficacious in preventing T2D. Yet most Americans, especially those who are overweight/obese, are not physically active. Socioenvironmental barriers to physical activity (PA) such as body image concerns and limited access to fitness facilities contribute to the low levels of PA observed in overweight/obese adults. Web-based PA programs have been developed to address these barriers, but the outcomes have been marginal. Qualitative studies suggest that individuals who are overweight/obese prefer PA programs that feature people they can relate to especially in body size, fitness status and age. Previously, the investigators have included these preferences in a technology-based Physical Activity for The Heart (PATH) intervention that leverages open source platforms, such as YouTube, to promote PA in any setting. In this application, the investigators propose to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of PATH in promoting PA and reducing cardiometabolic risk in adults who are overweight/obese and at high risk of diabetes. In Aim 1 the investigators will conduct a 12-week randomized clinical trial including 52 adults who are overweight/obese and at high risk of diabetes to assess the feasibility and acceptability of PATH. In Aim 2 investigators will examine the trend in PA and cardiometabolic risk change from baseline to post-intervention. This approach is innovative because it leverages open source technologies to provide low-cost, action-oriented PA resources that match the preferences of adults who are overweight/obese.

Surprisingly, exercise intolerance does not correlate with the degree of cardiac contractile (ventricular) dysfunction, suggesting that changes in the peripheral circulation may be to blame for exercise intolerance in this cohort. Though there are a host of factors that may contribute to this impairment, disease-related increases in circulating endothelin-1 (ET-1) may be a significant factor in the sequelae of exercise intolerance in HF.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* If energy intake is substantially increased to compensate energy expenditure and prevent weight loss following an extreme exercise prescription, will significant changes in body composition and body fat distribution be observed?
* Will these changes translate into improvements in the cardiometabolic health profile even in the absence of weight loss?

Participants will be asked to partake in several evaluations: fasting plasma lipoprotein-lipid profile and inflammation markers, glycated hemoglobin, cardiorespiratory fitness, submaximal exercise test including measurement of energy expenditure, resting and exercise blood pressure and heart rate, evaluation of regional adiposity, liver fat content, epi/pericardial fat, nutritional quality, and level of physical activity. After baseline evaluations, participants will be asked to alternately bike 208 km and 104 km per day on a pre-specified course for seven consecutive days. They will be accompanied during each of the seven bike rides by research professionals in a recreational vehicle. Participants' weight, body composition and waist circumference will be measured under standardized conditions in the morning after an overnight fast and after the exercise.

NCT04280783,Active You: A Novel Exercise Program for African Americans,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04280783,,COMPLETED,"Barriers to physical activity (PA) among African Americans (AAs) have been extensively studied, yet there is a paucity of innovative PA interventions designed to address them. In recent years, many studies have used the internet to promote PA in many settings, including the home environment, but only a few studies have recruited AAs. Without innovative and culturally relevant interventions, AAs will continue reporting extremely low levels of PA and disparate cardiovascular health outcomes. In prior work, the investigators sought the input of AA focus groups to inform the development of a technology-based Physical Activity for The Heart (PATH) intervention that leverages openly accessible platforms, such as YouTube, to promote PA in any setting. The investigators designed PATH as a culturally salient action-oriented intervention that can be accessed in any setting to promote PA among inactive AAs. In this application, the investigators propose to examine whether PATH is a feasible strategy for promoting PA among inactive AAs. In Aim 1 the investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial that will include 30 inactive AAs to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the PATH intervention. In Aim 2 the investigators will examine the trend in PA and cardiovascular disease risk change from baseline to post-intervention. This approach is innovative because it leverages openly accessible technologies to provide a wide variety of free, enjoyable and action-oriented workout videos that match AAs preferences.

NCT01563107,Dietary Sodium's Effect on Urinary Sodium and Dopamine Excretion in Patients With Postural Tachycardia Syndrome,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01563107,,COMPLETED,"Patients with Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) may not adequately expand their plasma volume in response to a high sodium diet. Mechanisms involved in the regulation of plasma volume, such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and renal dopamine (DA), may be impaired in POTS and may respond inappropriately to changes in dietary sodium. The investigators propose that the changes in urinary sodium and dopamine excretion caused by consuming low-sodium and high-sodium diets will be different between patients with POTS and healthy volunteers. The purpose of this study is to determine (1) whether changes in dietary sodium level appropriately influence sodium excretion in POTS; (2) whether changes in dietary sodium level appropriately influence DA excretion in POTS; (3) whether a high dietary sodium level appropriately expands plasma volume in POTS; and (4) whether patients with POTS have improvements in their orthostatic tachycardia and symptoms as a result of a high dietary sodium level.",YES,Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome,RADIATION: Plasma Volume|PROCEDURE: Exercise Capacity Test - Bicycle|PROCEDURE: Posture Study,"24hr Urinary Sodium, Amount of sodium excreted in urine over 24hr ending on Day 7, Day 6 am - Day 7 am for each dietary sodium level|24hr Urinary Dopamine, Amount of dopamine excreted in urine over 24 hours ending on Day 7, Between Day 6 am - Day 7 am of each dietary sodium level","Plasma Volume, Plasma volume (PV) was determined by the indicator tracer-dilution technique, using the DAXOR Blood Volume Analyzer (BVA)-100 system (DAXOR Corporation), on Day 7 of the low sodium and high sodium dietary interventions., after 7 days of each dietary sodium level|Magnitude of Orthostatic Tachycardia, Whether the magnitude of the heart rate increase that occurs in patients with POTS when moving from a supine to an upright position is attenuated by a High Sodium diet relative to a Low Sodium diet.

Heart rate was assessed after overnight rest and fasting after midnight, following at least 60 minutes of lying quietly. Heart rate was then measured at intervals after subjects had been standing for up to 30 minutes (as tolerated). Differences between supine and standing values are presented for 5 minutes standing (or maximal stand if \<5 minutes) since several patients were unable to stand for 10 minutes.

Data in POTS patients were compared to that of Healthy Controls., Supine and upright heart rate were measured after 6 days of each dietary sodium level|Upright Symptom Score, Whether upright symptoms were improved in patients with POTS on a High Sodium diet relative to a Low Sodium diet.

Patients were asked to report their standing symptom burden at the end of the Stand portion of the posture study, using the Vanderbilt Orthostatic Symptoms Scale (VOSS). They rated the severity of nine symptoms (palpitations, lightheadedness, mental confusion, blurred vision, shortness of breath, tremulousness, chest discomfort, headache, and nausea) on a scale ranging from a minimum of 0 (reflecting an absence of symptoms) to a maximum score of 10. The sum of the individual symptom scores was used to calculate orthostatic symptom burden for each participant. The lowest possible total score was 0, if a participant scored all 9 questions as 0, and the highest possible score was 90, if a participant scored all 9 questions as 10.

NCT03917576,Heart Rate During Exercise in Type 2 Diabetes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03917576,HRinT2DM,COMPLETED,"Exercise training is a cornerstone for the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders and associated cardiometabolic complications such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and hypertension. Similar to the beneficial health effects after performing conventional continuous exercise modalities, high intensity interval training (HIIT) has been reported as an effective alternative exercise-modality to improve glucose homeostasis in both prediabetes subjects and individuals with T2D diagnosed. In this regard, although multiple HIIT-based interventions commonly report acute and long term benefits on body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness and insulin sensitivity in metabolically compromised subjects, little is known about the acute cardiovascular response (i.e., at heart rate level) during HIIT in subjects with different glucose control.

HIIT is described as performing brief periods of exercise at vigorous or maximal intensity, interspersed with inactive or low intensity recovery phases of variable duration. In order to characterize different HIIT-based protocols, exercise intensity is usually defined as relative percentages of individual maximal cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) or relative maximal power output values. Nevertheless, the need for specific technological equipment to assess these parameters usually limit the prescription and recommendations of HIIT in clinical settings and other public health contexts at massive level. Additionally, the use of self-perceived exertion scales and heart rate (HR) variations upon HIIT have been demonstrating to be accessible and feasible strategies to regulate exercise intensity during HIIT. For example, it was reported that HR and self-perceived exertion scores increased progressively in T2D subjects, parallel to the oxygen consumption rate throughout an acute HIIT session performed on cycle ergometer. Consequently, it is conceivable to hypothesize that determining HR variations during HIIT might optimize the recommendation of this training methodology in metabolically compromised subjects as those at risk or with T2D diagnosed. Therefore, the aim of the present study was To describe and compare the acute heart rate changes in response to an incremental maximal exercise test and a single HIIT session between normoglycaemic (NG), prediabetes (Pre-T2D) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) subjects.",NO,Type2 Diabetes Mellitus|Hyperglycemia|Heart Rate|Exercise Training,OTHER: Behavioral|OTHER: Exercise training intervention,"Maximum heart rate, Measured before and after 12 weeks of high-intensity interval training, 12 weeks","Resting heart rate, Measured before and after 12 weeks of high-intensity interval training, 12 weeks|Heart rate pre each HIIT-interval, Measured before and after 12 weeks of high-intensity interval training, 12 weeks|Heart rate post each HIIT-interval, Measured before and after 12 weeks of high-intensity interval training, 12 weeks",,Universidad de Los Lagos,Universidad de La Frontera,FEMALE,ADULT,NA,75,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION,RP010317,2018-01-04,2018-04-04,2018-04-07,2019-04-17,,2019-04-17,"Cristian ALvarez, Osorno, 5290000, Chile","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/76/NCT03917576/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"

The aim of this study is to establish the potential utility of DCE-MRI as a novel endpoint for dose ranging and proof of mechanism studies of TRPV4 blockers. The DCE-MRI markers of vascular permeability and pulmonary oedema will be measured in subjects with HF (group 2) and healthy volunteers (HV) (group 1) at rest to determine if there is a difference between the two populations. Apart from this, exercise induced changes relative to rest in interstitial volume and exchange rate will be evaluated in both HV and subjects with HF. Additionally, the capability of DCE-MRI to detect changes in interstitial lung fluid in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) (group 3) will be investigated. DCE-MRI markers of pulmonary oedema will be assessed when patients are initially hospitalized with ADHF and subsequently after receiving standard of care treatment to determine whether differences can be detected by this methodology.This study will enrol a sufficient number of subjects to have at least 24 subjects in Group 1 and 2 (group 1:12 HV and group 2: 12 subjects with HF) and atleast 5 subjects in Group 3.

Participants will either start by consuming peanuts for 4 weeks, and then go on to exercise at high intensity intervals (HIIT) for 4 weeks, or the reverse order. The study will test and compare the effect of peanuts and exercise on inflammation and heart rate variability as indicators of heart health. Specifically, the study will measure inflammation in the blood because there is evidence that higher inflammation is found in heart disease patients. There is also evidence that inflammation is related to death as a result of heart disease in healthy individuals. Finally, there are ongoing trials targeting these markers to improve heart health. The study hypothesizes that peanuts and exercise will reduce inflammation. It is also expected to find less inflammation because exercise and peanut consumption activate a part of the nervous system that has been shown to cause a similar effect.

Additionally, previous studies show that inflammation involves the mitochondria in the cell, the part of the cell that produces energy.
