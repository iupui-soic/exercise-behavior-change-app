NCT01394705,FITT Exercise Counseling With Interactive Accelerometry and Physical Activity in Adolescents at Increased Risk of Early Cardiovascular Disease: A Pilot Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01394705,,COMPLETED,"This pilot study seeks to compare the change in energy expenditure and fitness levels of patients seen in the Children's Hospital Preventive Cardiology program receiving standard of care provider exercise counseling to similar patients receiving Frequency, Intensity, Time, Type (FITT) exercise prescription and counseling combined with BodyMedia supported by an online interactive tool.

The investigators primary hypothesis is that this interactive technology coupled with support from a exercise specialist will increase the energy expenditure of the investigators patients over standard of care provider counseling.

The investigators Secondary hypotheses include greater improvement in measured physical fitness Peak oxygen consumption (VO2max), oxygen consumption (VO2) at anaerobic threshold (AT) and ventilation/carbon dioxide (VE/VCO2) slope, lipid profiles, blood pressure, arterial stiffness, body mass index (BMI), BMI percentile, and self-efficacy in the intervention group compared to control.",YES,Coronary Artery Disease Risk High,DEVICE: BodyMedia,"Physical Activity, Total time (minutes) in Physical Activity in one week, Baseline, 3 months","Body Mass Index, Secondary hypotheses include greater improvement in body mass index (BMI) reported below., Baseline, 3 months",,Boston Children's Hospital,,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT",NA,42,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,P00000416,2011-06,2017-08,2017-09,2011-07-14,2018-11-28,2019-05-29,"Childrens Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/05/NCT01394705/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"
NCT01109992,Integrated Dual Exercise and Lexiscan Positron Emission Tomography: IDEALPET,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01109992,IDEALPET,COMPLETED,This is a single-center study of subjects undergoing clinically indicated heart scans for evaluation of known or suspected heart disease. We will also include 10 healthy subjects without known heart disease. We would like to study stress testing of the heart using exercise and a medication called regadenoson.

Count of subjects with ischemic ECG changes is reported
2. Count of subjects with systolic blood pressure decrease \> 20 mm Hg is reported
3. Count of subjects with abnormal serum troponin T levels is reported
4. Radiation dose to the staff will be measured using personal dosimeters after the Lexiscan as well as the Lexercise PET study., Day of the research scan during the stress test","Image Quality: Heart to Liver Ratio of Counts, Sub-diaphragmatic activity: Heart to Liver Ratio was measured on the rubidium-82 and N-13 ammonia scans. Since this measure is a ratio it has no units. Mean and Standard Deviation of Ratio is reported for each group.

This was measured on the clinical scan and on the research scan which were performed about 2 weeks apart in most subjects., Week 1 (day of the clinical scan), and Week 2 (day of the research scan)|Changes in Left Ventricular Function With Dual Exercise and Regadenoson PET, Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at stress was measured at Stress scan 1 (regadenoson) and Stress scan 2 (regadenoson or exercise + regadenoson).

NCT03276546,SHARE-D: a Decision Tool to Help Patients Make Informed Lifestyle Choices,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03276546,SHARE-D,COMPLETED,"More information is needed about effective ways to help people begin to change their lifestyle behaviours, particularly physical activity and diet. The investigators propose to test a 'tool' that can be used to guide discussions between people and health professionals about their physical activity and diet habits, so that people may be supported better in making decisions about why and how they might begin to fit more exercise and healthy food into their daily routines and make long-term changes. The investigators will explore the feasibility of using this tool in general practice, reviewing behaviours after 1 and 3 months. Patients' and healthcare professionals' views of its use and how it influenced decisions will inform development of the tool's design and a study of its effectiveness in helping people to begin to change their behaviour and achieve healthy lifestyles.",YES,Health Behavior,BEHAVIORAL: shared decision-making tool (SHARE-D),"Recruitment Rate, numbers of patients attending a baseline assessment, compared to numbers invited to participate, 4 months overall recruitment (responses to invitations recorded within 4 weeks of invitation being sent)","Completion Rate, numbers of enrolled participants who complete all assessments and reviews, 3 months|Diet Behaviour - Fibre Intake, Dietary Instrument for Nutritional Education (DINE) questionnaire - measure of diet fibre content; maximum score = 61; minimum = 3; higher score indicates better outcome, 3 months|Physical Activity Behaviour, RPAQ questionnaire -self-reported frequency of episodes of different activities representing levels of sedentary behaviour and of light, moderate and vigorous physical activity in 4 weeks prior to completion of the questionnaire; focus on measure of sedentary behaviour indicated by time (hours) spent watching TV/weekday, 3 months|Objective Measure of Physical Activity, accelerometer measurement of duration of light, moderate and vigorous physical activity per day over a 7-day period, 2 periods of 7-day measurement: baseline and after 3 months",,"Queen's University, Belfast",Northern Ireland Chest Heart and Stroke,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,23,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION,16/LO/0655,2016-06,2017-01-31,2017-01-31,2017-09-08,2022-02-17,2024-01-22,,"Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/46/NCT03276546/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"
