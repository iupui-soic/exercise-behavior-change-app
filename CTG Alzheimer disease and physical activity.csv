NCT01958437,Enhancing Spatial Navigation Using Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01958437,,COMPLETED,"Remembering how to travel from one location to another is critical in everyday life, yet this vital ability declines with normal aging and can be further affected by conditions that disproportionately affect the elderly, such as vision loss or progressive dementia. Human and animal research has shown that two distinct memory systems interact during navigation. The first, referred to as allocentric navigation, is very flexible and uses spatial knowledge of key features or landmarks to develop and use a mental map of the environment. This approach involves brain regions that are critical for new learning and memory but that decline with age. The second, referred to as egocentric navigation, is inflexible and relies on ""habit"" memories that link specific features with specific directions. This approach relies on brain regions that are critical for ""automatic"" responses and that are relatively unaffected by age.

The main problem is that allocentric navigation declines with age and is accompanied increased dependence on egocentric navigation. This change increases the risk of becoming disoriented or ""lost"" when traveling in unfamiliar areas or even when traveling new routes in familiar areas. Therefore, the main goal of this project is to examine whether non-invasive brain stimulation, specifically transcranial direct current stimulation, can improve allocentric navigation in healthy older adults and patients with mild cognitive impairment.

Participants will complete two functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions while learning new environments. Before one of these sessions, participants will receive active brain stimulation over the parietal cortex. Before the other session, participants will receive sham brain stimulation over the parietal cortex. The effects of this stimulation will be evaluated using both an allocentric and an egocentric memory test.

NCT03656107,The Cognition and Flow Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03656107,,TERMINATED,"About the research

There are currently 850,000 people living with dementia in the United Kingdom. It is now understand that Alzheimer's disease (AzD) can result from damaged blood vessels in the brain. Brain blood flow can be measured using ultrasound, known as transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (or TCD).

Brain training (BT) uses exercises or brain-teasers to try to make the brain work faster and more accurately. In recent years, BT has been used to try to improve memory, mood, learning, quality of life, and ability to carry out every-day activities in people with dementia.

Aims

1. To find out how acceptable and manageable this BT program is for people with dementia to undertake larger studies of BT in the future.
2. To look for any benefits for people with dementia, such as, improvements in quality of life, ability to carry out everyday tasks, mood, and brain blood flow.

How will the research be carried out?

* Forty patients with AzD, or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and twenty healthy older adults will be recruited from memory and geriatric clinics, Join Dementia Research, general practice surgeries and community groups.
* Participants will be randomly assigned to brain training or control. The control group will be offered the program at the end of the study.
* First visit: Participants will complete questionnaires on quality of life, mood, everyday abilities, memory and an assessment of brain blood flow
* Brain training program: Participants will complete 15-30 minute sessions, 3-5 times per week
* Follow-up: participants will repeat the questionnaires and assessment of brain blood flow
* Interviews and feedback: to discuss how participants felt the program went, and find out if there are any ways it could be improved.",YES,Dementia|Alzheimer Disease|Mild Cognitive Impairment|Aging|Cognitive Impairment,BEHAVIORAL: Cognitive Training,"Percentage of Participants Successfully Recruited, Feasibility, 15 months|Percentage of Participants Able to Successfully Complete the Minimum (15 Mins, 3x Per Week, for 8 Weeks) and Maximum (30 Mins, 5x Per Week, for 12 Weeks) Criteria CT Program and Complete All Assessments, Feasibility, 17 months|Percentage of Participants With Full Bilateral Data for Cerebral Blood Flow Velocity (CBFv), Feasibility CBFv as measured using transcranial Doppler ultrsonography (TCD), 17 months|Percentage of Control Participants Willing to be Randomised to Waiting List Control, Feasibility, 17 months","Change in Cognition Score as Detected by the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-III) From Baseline to Follow-up at 12 Weeks, cognitive function.

NCT03634033,Implementation of CAPABLE in the Michigan Medicaid Waiver,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03634033,,COMPLETED,"Main study: Nearly half of older adults report problems with function, which can lead to difficulty with activities of daily living and nursing home placement. Thus, there is a need to implement evidence-based models of care to improve function and those factors that support function in older adults living in the community. One such model is CAPABLE (Community Aging in Place Advancing Better Living for Elders), a person-centered, nurse and occupational therapy intervention supported by assistive devices and home modifications. The investigators build on prior work that translated CAPABLE and conducted preliminary testing of a package of implementation strategies. This R15 application will test site-level adoption and sustainability after deploying a package of implementation strategies (readiness assessment, training, facilitation, champions, coalition building, and audit and feedback). Sites will be randomized to internal facilitation alone or internal facilitation plus external facilitation. This work will impact implementation science by testing two approaches to implementation of an evidence-based intervention to improve outcomes among older adults in a Medicaid Waiver program.

ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPLEMENT We extend the Parent Trial by addressing a problem found while deploying CAPABLE with beneficiaries with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or dementia. There are 39.8 million informal caregivers in the US and 16.3 million who care for someone with AD or dementia; and 1,500 of those are in the Michigan waiver. Most beneficiaries with those conditions did not accept CAPABLE as they were unable to receive instruction. Interventions that improve caregiver knowledge, confidence, and self-efficacy improve care they provide. Thus, the goal is to extend provision of CAPABLE to beneficiaries with AD or dementia via the engagement of their informal caregivers. This work is significant as there are 1,500 beneficiaries with AD or dementia in the waiver who could benefit from CAPABLE yet many did not, as they were to receive instructions. To date, CAPABLE has only been designed to be used directly with the individuals without caregiver involvement. In the waiver, beneficiaries are required to have a designated caregiver, therefore, modifying the toolkit for use by caregivers could aid in deploying CAPABLE to beneficiaries with AD or dementia.",YES,Independent Living,BEHAVIORAL: MiCAP with IF (Main Study)|BEHAVIORAL: MiCAP with IF and EF (Main Study)|BEHAVIORAL: MiCAP with IF and Caregiver Engagement (Administrative Supplement),"Main Study: Effect of MiCAP With IF Alone Versus MiCAP With IF+EF on Site-level Outcomes of Adoption and Sustainability of CAPABLE, Adoptions and sustainability of the intervention using the Stages of Implementation Completion (SIC) at a site (18).

This assessment includes 15 questions (14 of which contribute to the total score, and 1 additional unscored item) that assess the participant's perceived ability to perform high-level functional tasks in daily-life and sense of overall cognitive functional ability. Study participants and their informants independently rate the participant's abilities. A participant-reported and an informant-reported total score is calculated which ranges from 0 to 14 (yes=1; no=0; maybe=0.5 for each question) with higher scores indicating greater impairment., Baseline and Endpoint (Month 24)|Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living - Prevention Instrument (ADCS-ADLPI) Total Score at Endpoint (Month 24), The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living -Prevention Instrument (ADCS-ADLPI) is a functional measure composed of 18 items that includes 15 activities of daily living rated on a 4-point scale and 3 high level function items. Study participants and their informants independently rate the participant's level of ability (with no difficulty = 3, with some difficulty = 2, with a lot of difficulty = 1, did not do/don't know = 0). Informants are additionally asked to evaluate whether activities were completed less often, required more time to complete, and if any errors were made performing the task. High-level function items are rated as ""yes"" or ""no"". The scores range from 0 to 45 with higher scores indicating less impairment. The total score is the sum of the scores of the 15 activities of daily living questions (range: 0-45) with higher scores indicating less impairment., Baseline and Endpoint (Month 24)|Change From Baseline in Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) Total Scale Score at Endpoint (Month 24), RBANS is 20 to 25 minute battery developed for cognitive assessment, detection, and characterization of dementia.
