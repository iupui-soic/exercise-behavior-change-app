NCT03475316,Movement Intervention for Memory Enhancement,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03475316,MIME,COMPLETED,"Dancing is a complex sensorimotor rhythmic activity that integrates cognitive, physical, and social components and is applicable to seniors with various fitness levels. Despite its popularity, there is a paucity of studies that have systematically examined the role of dancing in preventing or delaying cognitive decline in older adults at high risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.

(1) The Digit Symbol Substitution test is a measure of attention and speed of processing. Scoring is based on the total number of correct responses generated over 90 seconds. Higher values reflect better outcome. (2) Flanker Test is a measure of speed of processing, attention and inhibitory control. Scoring is based on accuracy and reaction time. Lower values reflect better outcome. (3) Walking While Talking (repeating alternating letters of the alphabet) gait speed (centimeters/second) will be measured using a electronic walkway system. Higher values reflect better outcome. The scores on the 3 tests are standardized and summed to obtain a single z-score. The Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean of the study population and a value of 0 is equal to the mean. Negative numbers indicate values lower than the mean and positive numbers indicate values higher than the mean., Baseline, 6 months","Neuroplasticity., Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging will be used to investigate neuroplasticity under three conditions: 'imagined Walking While Talking' task, Digit Symbol Substitution test and Flanker interference tests.

The values measured as factor scores reflect change in functional activation/deactivation covariance patterns from pre to post intervention as a function intervention (social dancing vs. treadmill walking).

NCT03656107,The Cognition and Flow Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03656107,,TERMINATED,"About the research

There are currently 850,000 people living with dementia in the United Kingdom. It is now understand that Alzheimer's disease (AzD) can result from damaged blood vessels in the brain. Brain blood flow can be measured using ultrasound, known as transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (or TCD).

Brain training (BT) uses exercises or brain-teasers to try to make the brain work faster and more accurately. In recent years, BT has been used to try to improve memory, mood, learning, quality of life, and ability to carry out every-day activities in people with dementia.

Aims

1. To find out how acceptable and manageable this BT program is for people with dementia to undertake larger studies of BT in the future.
2. To look for any benefits for people with dementia, such as, improvements in quality of life, ability to carry out everyday tasks, mood, and brain blood flow.

How will the research be carried out?

* Forty patients with AzD, or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and twenty healthy older adults will be recruited from memory and geriatric clinics, Join Dementia Research, general practice surgeries and community groups.
* Participants will be randomly assigned to brain training or control. The control group will be offered the program at the end of the study.
* First visit: Participants will complete questionnaires on quality of life, mood, everyday abilities, memory and an assessment of brain blood flow
* Brain training program: Participants will complete 15-30 minute sessions, 3-5 times per week
* Follow-up: participants will repeat the questionnaires and assessment of brain blood flow
* Interviews and feedback: to discuss how participants felt the program went, and find out if there are any ways it could be improved.",YES,Dementia|Alzheimer Disease|Mild Cognitive Impairment|Aging|Cognitive Impairment,BEHAVIORAL: Cognitive Training,"Percentage of Participants Successfully Recruited, Feasibility, 15 months|Percentage of Participants Able to Successfully Complete the Minimum (15 Mins, 3x Per Week, for 8 Weeks) and Maximum (30 Mins, 5x Per Week, for 12 Weeks) Criteria CT Program and Complete All Assessments, Feasibility, 17 months|Percentage of Participants With Full Bilateral Data for Cerebral Blood Flow Velocity (CBFv), Feasibility CBFv as measured using transcranial Doppler ultrsonography (TCD), 17 months|Percentage of Control Participants Willing to be Randomised to Waiting List Control, Feasibility, 17 months","Change in Cognition Score as Detected by the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-III) From Baseline to Follow-up at 12 Weeks, cognitive function.
