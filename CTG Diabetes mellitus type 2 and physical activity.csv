NCT04621045,Active You: Feasibility of a Unique Physical Activity Program to Prevent Diabetes and Heart Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04621045,,COMPLETED,"Individuals who are overweight/obese are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes (T2D). Current evidence suggests that PA, even without dietary prescription, can be efficacious in preventing T2D. Yet most Americans, especially those who are overweight/obese, are not physically active. Socioenvironmental barriers to physical activity (PA) such as body image concerns and limited access to fitness facilities contribute to the low levels of PA observed in overweight/obese adults. Web-based PA programs have been developed to address these barriers, but the outcomes have been marginal. Qualitative studies suggest that individuals who are overweight/obese prefer PA programs that feature people they can relate to especially in body size, fitness status and age. Previously, the investigators have included these preferences in a technology-based Physical Activity for The Heart (PATH) intervention that leverages open source platforms, such as YouTube, to promote PA in any setting. In this application, the investigators propose to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of PATH in promoting PA and reducing cardiometabolic risk in adults who are overweight/obese and at high risk of diabetes. In Aim 1 the investigators will conduct a 12-week randomized clinical trial including 52 adults who are overweight/obese and at high risk of diabetes to assess the feasibility and acceptability of PATH. In Aim 2 investigators will examine the trend in PA and cardiometabolic risk change from baseline to post-intervention. This approach is innovative because it leverages open source technologies to provide low-cost, action-oriented PA resources that match the preferences of adults who are overweight/obese.

NCT03077360,Skeletal Muscle Diacylglycerol and Sphingolipids - Impact of Localization and Species on Insulin Resistance in Humans,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03077360,,COMPLETED,"The rationale for the proposed research is that elucidating changes in localized diacylglycerol (DAG) and sphingolipid species that predict insulin sensitivity will reveal specific localized lipids to target in therapeutics for type 2 diabetes. To attain the overall objective, the investigators propose three specific aims: 1. Identify the influence of sarcolemmal DAG and sphingolipids on cell signaling and insulin sensitivity before and after insulin sensitizing lifestyle interventions. Strong preliminary data shape the hypothesis that sarcolemmal 1,2-disaturated DAG and C18:0 ceramide species will decrease after insulin sensitizing lifestyle interventions, leading to less Protein kinase C (PKC) and Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activation, and enhanced insulin signaling. Skeletal muscle DAG and sphingolipid isomers, species, localization, and de novo synthesis will be measured before and after diet-induced weight loss or exercise training interventions in obese men and women. Insulin sensitivity will be measured using insulin clamps, and muscle lipids using Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS). 2. Determine the impact of mitochondrial/ER (endoplasmic reticulum) DAG and sphingolipids on mitochondrial function and ER stress in vivo, before and after insulin sensitizing lifestyle interventions. The investigators hypothesize, again based on preliminary data, that mitochondrial/ER sphingolipids will decrease, yet DAG will increase after insulin sensitizing lifestyle interventions, and each will associate with increased insulin sensitivity. Changes in sphingolipids will relate to increased mitochondrial function, less ER stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and acyl-carnitine formation, while changes in DAG will relate to increased mitochondrial content and dynamics. 3. Identify the effect of exogenous DAG and sphingolipids on mitochondrial function in vitro, before and after insulin sensitizing lifestyle interventions. The working hypothesis is that DAG and sphingolipids will reduce mitochondrial respiration and increase ROS and acyl-carnitine content, but will be attenuated after endurance exercise training. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantive departure from the status quo by addressing cellular compartmentalization of bioactive lipids. The investigators contribution will be significant by identifying key species and locations of DAG and sphingolipids promoting insulin resistance, as well as mechanisms explaining accumulation that could be modified by insulin sensitizing therapeutic interventions.",YES,"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2|Pre-diabetes|Obesity",BEHAVIORAL: Lifestyle,"Percent Change in Insulin Sensitivity Compared to Baseline Measurement., Hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic clamp measured as glucose infusion rate in mg/kg/min., Baseline and 12 weeks|Percent Change in Localized Muscle Lipids Compared to Baseline, We measured changes in sarcolemmal, mitochondrial, nuclear and cytosolic lipids measured in pmol/ug protein after compared to before the interventions, Baseline and 12 weeks|Percent Change in Body Weight Compared to Baseline Measurement, This is the percent change in body weight for each group after the 12 week intervention., Baseline, 3 Months",,,"University of Colorado, Denver",National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK),ALL,ADULT,NA,62,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,16-1404|5R01DK111559,01-02-2017,19-11-2020,19-11-2020,10-03-2017,06-01-2022,21-06-2022,"University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/60/NCT03077360/Prot_SAP_000.pdf|Informed Consent Form, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/60/NCT03077360/ICF_001.pdf"

A substantial literature documents the effectiveness of Diabetes Self-Management Education (DSME) programs for improving diabetes outcomes, although little high-quality data are available in Thailand, and traditional delivery models (health-professional led one-to-one or small-group sessions) are unlikely to be scalable in Thailand given current human resource and budgetary constraints. Thus, a low-cost DSME program will be developed with a scalable delivery model for roll-out within the Thai primary care system. The intervention will be based on behaviour-change and social support theories, delivered in monthly group meetings by lay health workers or nurses, and aided by a suite of short films to introduce key topics and stimulate discussion. 21 primary care units will be randomised to offer to those with diabetes diagnosed within the first three years. DSME will be delivered by lay health workers, nurses (for comparative effectiveness), or usual care. After 12 months, glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk scores will be compared between the three arms. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed, also process and policy evaluations to produce best-buy recommendations for the Thai Ministry of Public Health.",NO,"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",BEHAVIORAL: A low-cost DSME program and scalable delivery model for roll-out within the Thai primary care system,"Hemoglobin A1c levels (HbA1c), HbA1c will measures the average blood glucose (sugar) levels months, 12 months|Total cardiovascular risk, The cardiovascular risk will be estimated by Systemic Coronary Risk Evaluation.

NCT03917576,Heart Rate During Exercise in Type 2 Diabetes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03917576,HRinT2DM,COMPLETED,"Exercise training is a cornerstone for the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders and associated cardiometabolic complications such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and hypertension. Similar to the beneficial health effects after performing conventional continuous exercise modalities, high intensity interval training (HIIT) has been reported as an effective alternative exercise-modality to improve glucose homeostasis in both prediabetes subjects and individuals with T2D diagnosed. In this regard, although multiple HIIT-based interventions commonly report acute and long term benefits on body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness and insulin sensitivity in metabolically compromised subjects, little is known about the acute cardiovascular response (i.e., at heart rate level) during HIIT in subjects with different glucose control.

HIIT is described as performing brief periods of exercise at vigorous or maximal intensity, interspersed with inactive or low intensity recovery phases of variable duration. In order to characterize different HIIT-based protocols, exercise intensity is usually defined as relative percentages of individual maximal cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) or relative maximal power output values. Nevertheless, the need for specific technological equipment to assess these parameters usually limit the prescription and recommendations of HIIT in clinical settings and other public health contexts at massive level. Additionally, the use of self-perceived exertion scales and heart rate (HR) variations upon HIIT have been demonstrating to be accessible and feasible strategies to regulate exercise intensity during HIIT. For example, it was reported that HR and self-perceived exertion scores increased progressively in T2D subjects, parallel to the oxygen consumption rate throughout an acute HIIT session performed on cycle ergometer. Consequently, it is conceivable to hypothesize that determining HR variations during HIIT might optimize the recommendation of this training methodology in metabolically compromised subjects as those at risk or with T2D diagnosed. Therefore, the aim of the present study was To describe and compare the acute heart rate changes in response to an incremental maximal exercise test and a single HIIT session between normoglycaemic (NG), prediabetes (Pre-T2D) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) subjects.",NO,Type2 Diabetes Mellitus|Hyperglycemia|Heart Rate|Exercise Training,OTHER: Behavioral|OTHER: Exercise training intervention,"Maximum heart rate, Measured before and after 12 weeks of high-intensity interval training, 12 weeks","Resting heart rate, Measured before and after 12 weeks of high-intensity interval training, 12 weeks|Heart rate pre each HIIT-interval, Measured before and after 12 weeks of high-intensity interval training, 12 weeks|Heart rate post each HIIT-interval, Measured before and after 12 weeks of high-intensity interval training, 12 weeks",,Universidad de Los Lagos,Universidad de La Frontera,FEMALE,ADULT,NA,75,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION,RP010317,04-01-2018,04-04-2018,07-04-2018,17-04-2019,,17-04-2019,"Cristian ALvarez, Osorno, 5290000, Chile","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/76/NCT03917576/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"
