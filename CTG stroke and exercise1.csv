NCT04437251,Effect of Brain Stimulation on Stepping Performance in Stroke Survivors and Healthy Adults,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04437251,Gait,RECRUITING,"Participants are being asked to participate in a research study conducted by Shih-Chiao Tseng, PT, Ph.D. at Texas Woman's University. This research study is to determine whether low-intensive brain stimulation can enhance learning of a leg movement task. The investigators also want to know if brain stimulation can improve the nerve function and walking performance. Our goal is to understand any relationship between brain stimulation and overall movement control improvement. Participants have been invited to join this research if they have had a stroke before or they are healthy adults aged 21 years or older. Research evidence shows stroke can induce permanent brain damage and therefore may cause a person to have trouble learning a new task. This in turn may significantly impact the recovery of motor function in stroke survivors. In addition, the investigators also want to know how a healthy person learns this new leg task and see if her/his learning pattern differs from a stroke survivor.

This study comprises two phases: Phase I study investigates short-term effects of brain stimulation on leg skill learning and only requires two visits to TWU. The total time commitment for Phase I study will be about 6.5 hours, 3.5 hours on the first visit and three hours on the second visit; Phase II study is an expanded version of Phase I study to investigate long-term effects of brain stimulation on leg skill learning and requires to complete 12 visits of exercise training paired with brain stimulation over a four-week period and additional one visit for follow-up test. The total time commitment for Phase II study will be about 20 hours, a total of 18 hours for 12 exercise training sessions and two hours for a follow-up test. The investigators hypothesize that people with chronic stroke will show a slower rate of acquiring this leg skill as compared to healthy adults. The investigators also hypothesize that co-applying brain stimulation with 12 sessions of exercise training will enhance skill learning of this leg task for people with chronic stroke and this 12-session exercise program may exert beneficial influences on the nerve function and leg muscle activation, and consequentially improve motor control for walking.",NO,"Vascular Accident, Brain|CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident)|Gait, Hemiplegic|Spastic Lower Extremity Weakness",DEVICE: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS),"Changes in stepping reaction time (Phase I), Calculate the time duration for the central nervous system to process information and produce a stepping action., Measure changes in the reaction time before, immediately after (i.e. within a minute), and 30 minutes after a single session of brain stimulation.|Changes in stepping reaction time (Phase II), Calculate the time duration for the central nervous system to process information and produce a stepping action., Measure changes in reaction time before training, up to 24 hours after the completion of a 12-session training program, and one week after the completion of a 12-session training program.|Changes in walking performance (Phase I), Measure walking speed (meters/second) during ground walking at a self-selected speed., Measure changes in the walking speed before, immediately after (i.e. within a minute), and 30 minutes after a single session of brain stimulation.|Changes in walking performance (Phase I), Measure step length (centimeters) symmetry (left/right) during ground walking at a self-selected speed., Measure changes in the step length symmetry before, immediately after (i.e. within a minute), and 30 minutes after a single session of brain stimulation.|Changes in walking performance (Phase II), Measure walking speed (meters/second) during ground walking at a self-selected speed., Measure changes in the walking speed before training, up to 24 hours after the completion of a 12-session training program, and one week after the completion of a 12-session training program.|Changes in walking performance (Phase II), Measure step length symmetry (left/right) during ground walking at a self-selected speed., Measure changes in the step length symmetry before training, up to 24 hours after the completion of a 12-session training program, and one week after the completion of a 12-session training program.|Changes in nerve function (Phase I), Place a surface electrode on the calf muscle to record muscle activation triggered by electrical stimulation delivered to the motor neurons in the lesioned motor cortex and tibial nerve on the paretic leg to qualify changes in neuronal activity in the primary cortex and in the spinal cord before and after brain stimulation (tDCS)., Measure changes in the nerve function before, immediately after (i.e. within a minute), and 30 minutes after a single session of brain stimulation.|Changes in nerve function (Phase II), Place a surface electrode on the calf muscle to record muscle activation triggered by electrical stimulation delivered to the motor neurons in the lesioned motor cortex and tibial nerve on the paretic leg to qualify changes in neuronal activity in the primary cortex and in the spinal cord before and after brain stimulation (tDCS)., Measure changes in the nerve function before training, up to 24 hours after the completion of a 12-session training program), and one week after the completion of a 12-session training program.","Mini-mental State Examination (Phase I), A standardized questionnaires to evaluate the cognitive function consisting of 11 items with a possible summed score ranging from zero to 30.

The Modified Ashworth scale measures resistance during passive soft-tissue stretching and is used as a simple measure of spasticity. Higher scores indicate worse spasticity. The scores and scale are as follows:

0: No increase in muscle tone

1. Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension 1+: Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the range of motion.
2. More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the range of motion, but affected part(s) easily moved
3. Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult

The main question it aims to answer is:By using intelligent portable isokinetic tester and traditional isokinetic tester, isokinetic knee flexor and extensor muscles of stroke patients with hemiplegia were trained respectively, so as to observe and compare the effects of the two treatment methods. In addition, the therapeutic effect of the above two treatments was compared with that of exercise therapy alone. Participants will be divided into three groups: control group, intelligent isokinetic treatment group, and traditional isokinetic treatment group. Participants of both the control group and the two treatment groups received exercise therapy.

All stroke patients will be scanned before and after their training program while performing or imagining simple motor tasks. Behavioral assessments of motor and cognitive capacities will be collected at each timepoint. Healthy control subjects enrolled for device testing (20) will receive up to 5 training sessions in a modified robotic paradigm and 1 fMRI scan, in order to investigate motor learning and brain activity in a novel motor control task.
