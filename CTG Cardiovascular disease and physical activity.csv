1. To augment the MAHI Exo-II, a physical human exoskeleton, with a non-invasive brain machine interface (BMI) to actively include patient in the control loop and thereby making the therapy 'active'.
2. To determine appropriate robotic (kinematic data acquired through sensors on robotic device ) and electrophysiological ( electroencephalography- EEG based) measures of arm motor impairment and recovery after stroke.
3. To demonstrate that the BMI controlled MAHI Exo-II robotic arm training is feasible and effective in improving arm motor functions in sub-acute and chronic stroke population.",YES,Stroke|Hemiparesis,DEVICE: MAHI EXO-II exoskeleton augmented with BMI system,"Change From Baseline in Fugl-Meyer Arm (FMA) Motor Score, FMA is a stroke-specific, performance based impairment index. It quantitatively measures impairment based on Twitchell and Brunnstrom's concept of sequential stages of motor return in hemiplegic stroke patients. It uses an ordinal scale for scoring of 33 items for the upper limb component of the F-M scale (0:can not perform; 1:can perform partially; 2:can perform fully). Total range is 0-66, 0 being poor and 66 normal., Baseline, immediately after end of treatment (within a week), 2 weeks after end of treatment, 12 weeks after end of treatment|Neural Activity (Cortical Dynamics) Measured by Electroencephalography (EEG) Movement-related Cortical Potential (MRCP) Amplitude, EEG activity in the low-frequency delta band will be assessed. Scalp EEG electrodes will be located over the motor cortex, specifically, central (Cz, C1- C4), fronto- central (FCz, FC1 - FC4) and centro-parietal electrodes (CPz, CP1 - CP4). Further, to account for left hand vs. right hand impairment, the electrode locations will be flipped for individuals with right hand impairment. Increased MRCP amplitude indicates increased activation of the ipsi-lesional hemisphere or inhibition of competing contra-lesional hemisphere, following motor relearning., Baseline, immediately after end of treatment (within a week)|Cortical Dynamics Measured by Electroencephalography (EEG) Movement-related Cortical Potential (MRCP) Latency, EEG activity in the low-frequency delta band will be assessed. Scalp EEG electrodes will be located over the motor cortex, specifically, central (Cz, C1- C4), fronto- central (FCz, FC1 - FC4) and centro-parietal electrodes (CPz, CP1 - CP4). Further, to account for left hand vs. right hand impairment, the electrode locations will be flipped for individuals with right hand impairment. MRCP latency is the duration of MRCP prior to movement onset, and is defined as time difference starting from 50% of peak amplitude until the time of movement onset.

NCT04621045,Active You: Feasibility of a Unique Physical Activity Program to Prevent Diabetes and Heart Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04621045,,COMPLETED,"Individuals who are overweight/obese are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes (T2D). Current evidence suggests that PA, even without dietary prescription, can be efficacious in preventing T2D. Yet most Americans, especially those who are overweight/obese, are not physically active. Socioenvironmental barriers to physical activity (PA) such as body image concerns and limited access to fitness facilities contribute to the low levels of PA observed in overweight/obese adults. Web-based PA programs have been developed to address these barriers, but the outcomes have been marginal. Qualitative studies suggest that individuals who are overweight/obese prefer PA programs that feature people they can relate to especially in body size, fitness status and age. Previously, the investigators have included these preferences in a technology-based Physical Activity for The Heart (PATH) intervention that leverages open source platforms, such as YouTube, to promote PA in any setting. In this application, the investigators propose to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of PATH in promoting PA and reducing cardiometabolic risk in adults who are overweight/obese and at high risk of diabetes. In Aim 1 the investigators will conduct a 12-week randomized clinical trial including 52 adults who are overweight/obese and at high risk of diabetes to assess the feasibility and acceptability of PATH. In Aim 2 investigators will examine the trend in PA and cardiometabolic risk change from baseline to post-intervention. This approach is innovative because it leverages open source technologies to provide low-cost, action-oriented PA resources that match the preferences of adults who are overweight/obese.

NCT04919161,Explorations of the Benefits of the ZeroG TRiP System to Improve Balance in Patients Following Stroke,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04919161,,COMPLETED,"Strokes are neurological events that can lead to devastating physical and cognitive deficits, such as the inability to ambulate, impaired balance regulation, and loss of coordination. Due to the physical and cognitive deficits experienced following a stroke, many require admission to an inpatient rehabilitation facility to maximize their independence before returning to the home setting. The ability to walk, stand, climb stairs, and other mobility-related functional tasks, are critical components of achieving this functional independence. However, it is often difficult for post-stroke patients with balance impairments to safely practice balance and gait training without putting both therapists and patients at risk for injury. Incorporating robotic technologies to neurological rehabilitation can play a critical role in delivering safe and effective gait and balance therapy.

Body-weight support systems (BWSSs) unload paretic lower limbs, patients with gait impairments can practice a higher repetition of steps in a safe, controlled manner. As participants perform gait training, these systems support the participant's body-weight, permitting those with excessive weakness and poor coordination, to ambulate and perform more intensive therapy sessions sooner in their recovery, with minimal risk injurious fall. In addition to BWSSs, balance perturbation systems, which purposefully unbalance participants so to rehabilitate their postural control, have been used to improve gait and balance-control after stroke, or other age and disease related balance impairments.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a recently developed, not yet reported, balance perturbation module for the ZeroG BWSS. This new balance perturbation training module is directly integrated into the ZeroG BWSS and allows for the direct induction of safe lateral, anterior, and/or posterior perturbations via a Wi-Fi-enabled handheld device. During both stationary and ambulatory activities, this system was used unbalance participants in order to train their balance-control and balance-reactions. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine if this newly developed BWSS balance perturbation system more effectively rehabilitates participant gait and balance after stroke than the standard BWSS protocol without perturbations.",YES,Stroke|Balance; Distorted,DEVICE: Body weight support system control group|DEVICE: Body weight support system with balance perturbations,"Difference in Berg Balance Scale Pre-intervention and Post-intervention Assessment Scores, The Berg Balance Scale is a standardized objective measure of a subject/participant's balance.

Surprisingly, exercise intolerance does not correlate with the degree of cardiac contractile (ventricular) dysfunction, suggesting that changes in the peripheral circulation may be to blame for exercise intolerance in this cohort. Though there are a host of factors that may contribute to this impairment, disease-related increases in circulating endothelin-1 (ET-1) may be a significant factor in the sequelae of exercise intolerance in HF.

Often callers will provide an unclear response, and this can lead to hesitation on the part of the Emergency Medical Dispatcher (EMD). Further, the relatively small proportion OHCA calls represent might demand the need for simulation training in the dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DA-CPR) guiding itself. Therefore, the investigators investigate whether low-dose, high-frequency (LDHF) simulation-based training of EMDs can increase the quality of DA-CPR in a simulation setting. Additionally, the investigators measure whether the effect of the training will be transferred to real OHCA calls.

The study is a randomised controlled trial comparing LDHF simulation-based training to standard quality improvement of the EMD in a single centre. The study protocol is structured according to the SPIRIT 2013 statement, and the study will be reported in compliance with the CONSORT 2010 Statement. The investigators chose EMDs receiving standard quality improvement as the comparator group, to reflect a representative cohort of the EMDs not exposed to the LDHF simulation-based training program.

The aims of this study are:

1. To measure the effect of LDHF simulation-based training on the quality of DA-CPR in a simulation setting.
2. To measure the effect of LDHF simulation-based training on the quality of DA-CPR in real OHCA calls.

The investigators hypothesise that LDHF simulation-based training will increase the quality of DA-CPR in the intervention group in a simulation setting and that this improvement is transferred to real OHCA calls - although the effect in real OHCA calls might be smaller due to the complexity of some calls. The investigators hypothesise that this improvement can be detected as a decrease in time to first bystander compression (TTFC), an increase in clarification of consciousness and breathing without asking additional questions, a decrease in time to recognition of cardiac arrest, and an increase in calls where the EMD provide DA-CPR instructions on patients in cardiac arrest.",NO,Out-Of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest,"BEHAVIORAL: Low-Dose, High-Frequency Simulation-Based Training","Time from a call is taken by EMD to first bystander compression, (seconds), During cardiac arrest calls, up to 1 hour","EMD clarifies status of consciousness and breathing before asking any additional questions, (yes/no), During cardiac arrest calls, up to 1 hour|Time from a call is taken by EMD to the recognition of cardiac arrest, (seconds), During cardiac arrest calls, up to 1 hour|EMD starts DA-CPR instructions, (yes/no), During cardiac arrest calls, up to 1 hour|Time from a call is taken by EMD to EMD starts DA-CPR instructions, (seconds), During cardiac arrest calls, up to 1 hour|EMD is assertive when starting CPR instructions, (yes/no), During cardiac arrest calls, up to 1 hour|EMD starts DA-CPR instructions on patient without cardiac arrest, (yes/no), During cardiac arrest calls, up to 1 hour",,"Emergency Medical Services, Capital Region, Denmark","TrygFonden, Denmark",ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,52,OTHER_GOV,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,DTP,2019-09-12,2019-12-25,2019-12-25,2019-09-11,,2020-01-23,"Copenhagen Emergency Medical Services, Copenhagen, Denmark","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan: Full protocol, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/92/NCT04085692/Prot_SAP_000.pdf|Informed Consent Form, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/92/NCT04085692/ICF_001.pdf|Study Protocol: Supplementary assessment points for table 1, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/92/NCT04085692/Prot_002.pdf"
NCT06022588,Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia Breath Testing,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06022588,,COMPLETED,"Background and aims:

A gold standard diagnostic test to diagnose chronic mesenteric ischemia is currently lacking. Isotope labelled-butyrate and glucose breath testing could theoretically quantify mucosal oxygen consumption and thereby detect ischemia, since oxygen is needed to absorb and metabolize butyrate and glucose, and distinguish aerobic/anaerobic intestinal epithelial metabolism. Here we aim to test this notion and compare results to conventional biomarkers.

Methods:

Healthy volunteers were randomized into two control groups and two intervention groups, each consisting of five volunteers receiving either oral 13C -butyrate or 13C -glucose. The control groups performed breath tests without any physical exercise. The intervention groups performed a 30 minutes standardized bicycle exercise test, which has been proven to elicit mesenteric ischemia. Breath samples of expired 13CO2 were collected during a period of 4 hours and results were contrasted to measurements of biomarkers in peripheral blood.",NO,Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia,"DRUG: Sodium butyrate, 1-13C, 99%, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.USA|DRUG: U-13C6, 99%; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.USA|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Breath test|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Exercise + breath test","The median concentrations of measured 13CO2, The median concentrations of measured 13CO2 at each time point where compared within the four groups and statistically tested with a Mann - Whitney U test., At the following time points; baseline, 0.5, 1, 1.25 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 3, 3.5 and 4 hours (total of 12 time points) after ingestion of 13C-butyrate or 13C-glucose.",,,Erasmus Medical Center,,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,20,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: DIAGNOSTIC,NL72878.078.20,2021-03-01,2021-04-01,2021-08-01,2023-09-05,,2023-09-05,"Erasmus Medical Center - Department of Gastroenterology, Rotterdam, Netherlands","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/88/NCT06022588/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"

NCT05895916,Extreme Exercise and Energy Expenditure (4E) Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05895916,,COMPLETED,"The goal of this clinical trial is to provide evidence, through an extreme exercise prescription (1,144 km of road cycling on seven consecutive days), that weight loss is not the appropriate outcome to evaluate the effects of exercise on abdominal adiposity and ectopic fat depots (e.g. liver fat and epi/pericardial fat) in eleven recreational middle-aged male cyclists (aged 50 to 66 years) without symptoms of cardiovascular disease. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* If energy intake is substantially increased to compensate energy expenditure and prevent weight loss following an extreme exercise prescription, will significant changes in body composition and body fat distribution be observed?
* Will these changes translate into improvements in the cardiometabolic health profile even in the absence of weight loss?

Participants will be asked to partake in several evaluations: fasting plasma lipoprotein-lipid profile and inflammation markers, glycated hemoglobin, cardiorespiratory fitness, submaximal exercise test including measurement of energy expenditure, resting and exercise blood pressure and heart rate, evaluation of regional adiposity, liver fat content, epi/pericardial fat, nutritional quality, and level of physical activity. After baseline evaluations, participants will be asked to alternately bike 208 km and 104 km per day on a pre-specified course for seven consecutive days. They will be accompanied during each of the seven bike rides by research professionals in a recreational vehicle. Participants' weight, body composition and waist circumference will be measured under standardized conditions in the morning after an overnight fast and after the exercise. Their heart rate will be continuously monitored, and participants will wear accelerometers to estimate their daily exercise-related energy expenditure. Foods and fluids will be provided to participants and recorded. At the end of the 1,144 km/ 7-days bike ride, baseline evaluations will be repeated with the exception of the maximal exercise treadmill test, nutritional quality, and level of physical activity.

Primary treatment of PAD involves risk factor management; smoking cessation, management of blood pressure, blood cholesterol, diabetes, and exercise prescription. Patients with CLI typically require interventions to reestablish blood supply to their limbs.

In this study, patients with wake-up stroke will be randomized to thrombolysis with tenecteplase and best standard treatment or to best standard treatment without thrombolysis. Tenecteplase has several potential advantages over alteplase, including very rapid action and that it can be given as a single injection.

NCT05710653,Inter-individual Physiological Response to a Training and Detraining Period in Cardiometabolic Risk Factors Subjects,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05710653,VASCU-HEALTH,RECRUITING,"Background: Although exercise training is a well described therapy for some cardiometabolic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension, and metabolic syndrome, there is scarcity of knowledge about the post-exercise period term as 'detraining' where usually all physiological adaptations as cardiovascular and metabolic benefits are lost due to physical inactivity. Likewise, as some exercise training modalities as high-intensity interval training improve vascular parameters including endothelial dysfunction parameters as flow-mediated dilation (FMD%), and carotid-intima media thickness (c-IMT) during the 'training' period, there is little knowledge about how many 'volume' or 'intensity' of exercise training or physical activity per week is needed to maintain the exercise training benefits in populations with cardiometabolic risk factors such as those patients with arterial hypertension. This information will be of great interest for both improving and maintaining the vascular profile and health of Chilean adults with risk factors and to maintain a better vascular profile. Objective: To study the beneficial adaptations from the 'training' and 'detraining' period of exercise training on functional and structural vascular parameters in healthy and cardiometabolic risk factors adult subjects to improve the health profile. Methods: The investigators will conduct an experimental design of 5 groups of exercise training in healthy (controls) and hypertensive (HTN) patients (≥140 mmHg), with overweight/or obesity, men and women, with BMI ≥25 and ≤35 kg/m2, aged ≥18y, physically inactive (\<150 min/week of low/moderate PA/week, or \<75 min/week of vigorous PA) in the last 6 months will be invited for participating. The groups will be as follows; Group (HTNex will be compared with Group HTNcg). Group (ELEex will be compared with Group ELEcg). Group (NTex will be compared with Group NTcg). Each group will be compared in their physiological vascular adaptations before and after exercise training such as HIIT, and after 3 months of a detraining period.

Previous investigations have shown that recovery of swallowing functions occurs from reorganization (""rewiring"") of the non-involved cerebral hemisphere. In this study, the investigators propose to investigate a new intervention, which combines, swallowing exercises with brain stimulation targeted to the non-involved cerebral hemisphere, using low intensity current in acute stroke patients.

NCT04437251,Effect of Brain Stimulation on Stepping Performance in Stroke Survivors and Healthy Adults,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04437251,Gait,RECRUITING,"Participants are being asked to participate in a research study conducted by Shih-Chiao Tseng, PT, Ph.D. at Texas Woman's University. This research study is to determine whether low-intensive brain stimulation can enhance learning of a leg movement task. The investigators also want to know if brain stimulation can improve the nerve function and walking performance. Our goal is to understand any relationship between brain stimulation and overall movement control improvement. Participants have been invited to join this research if they have had a stroke before or they are healthy adults aged 21 years or older. Research evidence shows stroke can induce permanent brain damage and therefore may cause a person to have trouble learning a new task. This in turn may significantly impact the recovery of motor function in stroke survivors. In addition, the investigators also want to know how a healthy person learns this new leg task and see if her/his learning pattern differs from a stroke survivor.

This study comprises two phases: Phase I study investigates short-term effects of brain stimulation on leg skill learning and only requires two visits to TWU. The total time commitment for Phase I study will be about 6.5 hours, 3.5 hours on the first visit and three hours on the second visit; Phase II study is an expanded version of Phase I study to investigate long-term effects of brain stimulation on leg skill learning and requires to complete 12 visits of exercise training paired with brain stimulation over a four-week period and additional one visit for follow-up test. The total time commitment for Phase II study will be about 20 hours, a total of 18 hours for 12 exercise training sessions and two hours for a follow-up test. The investigators hypothesize that people with chronic stroke will show a slower rate of acquiring this leg skill as compared to healthy adults. The investigators also hypothesize that co-applying brain stimulation with 12 sessions of exercise training will enhance skill learning of this leg task for people with chronic stroke and this 12-session exercise program may exert beneficial influences on the nerve function and leg muscle activation, and consequentially improve motor control for walking.",NO,"Vascular Accident, Brain|CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident)|Gait, Hemiplegic|Spastic Lower Extremity Weakness",DEVICE: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS),"Changes in stepping reaction time (Phase I), Calculate the time duration for the central nervous system to process information and produce a stepping action., Measure changes in the reaction time before, immediately after (i.e. within a minute), and 30 minutes after a single session of brain stimulation.|Changes in stepping reaction time (Phase II), Calculate the time duration for the central nervous system to process information and produce a stepping action., Measure changes in reaction time before training, up to 24 hours after the completion of a 12-session training program, and one week after the completion of a 12-session training program.|Changes in walking performance (Phase I), Measure walking speed (meters/second) during ground walking at a self-selected speed., Measure changes in the walking speed before, immediately after (i.e. within a minute), and 30 minutes after a single session of brain stimulation.|Changes in walking performance (Phase I), Measure step length (centimeters) symmetry (left/right) during ground walking at a self-selected speed., Measure changes in the step length symmetry before, immediately after (i.e. within a minute), and 30 minutes after a single session of brain stimulation.|Changes in walking performance (Phase II), Measure walking speed (meters/second) during ground walking at a self-selected speed., Measure changes in the walking speed before training, up to 24 hours after the completion of a 12-session training program, and one week after the completion of a 12-session training program.|Changes in walking performance (Phase II), Measure step length symmetry (left/right) during ground walking at a self-selected speed., Measure changes in the step length symmetry before training, up to 24 hours after the completion of a 12-session training program, and one week after the completion of a 12-session training program.|Changes in nerve function (Phase I), Place a surface electrode on the calf muscle to record muscle activation triggered by electrical stimulation delivered to the motor neurons in the lesioned motor cortex and tibial nerve on the paretic leg to qualify changes in neuronal activity in the primary cortex and in the spinal cord before and after brain stimulation (tDCS)., Measure changes in the nerve function before, immediately after (i.e. within a minute), and 30 minutes after a single session of brain stimulation.|Changes in nerve function (Phase II), Place a surface electrode on the calf muscle to record muscle activation triggered by electrical stimulation delivered to the motor neurons in the lesioned motor cortex and tibial nerve on the paretic leg to qualify changes in neuronal activity in the primary cortex and in the spinal cord before and after brain stimulation (tDCS)., Measure changes in the nerve function before training, up to 24 hours after the completion of a 12-session training program), and one week after the completion of a 12-session training program.","Mini-mental State Examination (Phase I), A standardized questionnaires to evaluate the cognitive function consisting of 11 items with a possible summed score ranging from zero to 30.

NCT04280783,Active You: A Novel Exercise Program for African Americans,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04280783,,COMPLETED,"Barriers to physical activity (PA) among African Americans (AAs) have been extensively studied, yet there is a paucity of innovative PA interventions designed to address them. In recent years, many studies have used the internet to promote PA in many settings, including the home environment, but only a few studies have recruited AAs. Without innovative and culturally relevant interventions, AAs will continue reporting extremely low levels of PA and disparate cardiovascular health outcomes. In prior work, the investigators sought the input of AA focus groups to inform the development of a technology-based Physical Activity for The Heart (PATH) intervention that leverages openly accessible platforms, such as YouTube, to promote PA in any setting. The investigators designed PATH as a culturally salient action-oriented intervention that can be accessed in any setting to promote PA among inactive AAs. In this application, the investigators propose to examine whether PATH is a feasible strategy for promoting PA among inactive AAs. In Aim 1 the investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial that will include 30 inactive AAs to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the PATH intervention. In Aim 2 the investigators will examine the trend in PA and cardiovascular disease risk change from baseline to post-intervention. This approach is innovative because it leverages openly accessible technologies to provide a wide variety of free, enjoyable and action-oriented workout videos that match AAs preferences.

Mechanisms involved in the regulation of plasma volume, such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and renal dopamine (DA), may be impaired in POTS and may respond inappropriately to changes in dietary sodium. The investigators propose that the changes in urinary sodium and dopamine excretion caused by consuming low-sodium and high-sodium diets will be different between patients with POTS and healthy volunteers. The purpose of this study is to determine (1) whether changes in dietary sodium level appropriately influence sodium excretion in POTS; (2) whether changes in dietary sodium level appropriately influence DA excretion in POTS; (3) whether a high dietary sodium level appropriately expands plasma volume in POTS; and (4) whether patients with POTS have improvements in their orthostatic tachycardia and symptoms as a result of a high dietary sodium level.",YES,Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome,RADIATION: Plasma Volume|PROCEDURE: Exercise Capacity Test - Bicycle|PROCEDURE: Posture Study,"24hr Urinary Sodium, Amount of sodium excreted in urine over 24hr ending on Day 7, Day 6 am - Day 7 am for each dietary sodium level|24hr Urinary Dopamine, Amount of dopamine excreted in urine over 24 hours ending on Day 7, Between Day 6 am - Day 7 am of each dietary sodium level","Plasma Volume, Plasma volume (PV) was determined by the indicator tracer-dilution technique, using the DAXOR Blood Volume Analyzer (BVA)-100 system (DAXOR Corporation), on Day 7 of the low sodium and high sodium dietary interventions., after 7 days of each dietary sodium level|Magnitude of Orthostatic Tachycardia, Whether the magnitude of the heart rate increase that occurs in patients with POTS when moving from a supine to an upright position is attenuated by a High Sodium diet relative to a Low Sodium diet.

Heart rate was then measured at intervals after subjects had been standing for up to 30 minutes (as tolerated). Differences between supine and standing values are presented for 5 minutes standing (or maximal stand if \<5 minutes) since several patients were unable to stand for 10 minutes.

African Americans have been reported to have lower gut SCFA and SCFA can reduce blood pressure.

NCT05295810,Hypercapnia in Orthostatic Hypotension,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05295810,,RECRUITING,"The Autonomic (or ""automatic"") Nervous System (ANS) regulates internal processes, including control of heart rate and blood pressure (BP). When someone stands, and gravity tries to pull blood away from the brain, the ANS works to maintain BP and brain blood flow. Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension (NOH) occurs when our ""fight-or-flight"" part (""sympathetic"") of the ANS fails. BP can drop a lot when upright, reducing blood flow and oxygen delivery to the brain, and this can cause symptoms of light-headedness, nausea, and fainting.

One solution to help counter the effects of NOH may be to increase sympathetic activity by breathing higher levels of carbon dioxide. In healthy volunteers, small increases in the amount of inhaled carbon dioxide has been shown to increase BP in the upright position, and this improves symptoms!

The software is used to inform selfmanagement coaching by helping therapists understand more about how and when patients use their affected arm between treatment sessions. Design and methods: This study will assess the usability of the OnTrack Tools component of the system. The study will recruit stroke therapists from Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust to provide feedback on the experience and usability of OnTrack Tools' graphical user interface (GUI). The study will be divided into three progressive cycles of testing, feedback and iteration. Each cycle will see participants individually completing specific tasks related to system navigation and the management of patients under simulation. Participants will complete outcome measures and take part in focus groups. Researchers will analyse and use the feedback to improve the GUI ready for the next testing cycle. Patient and public involvement: The project team includes a PPIE group of stroke survivors who oversee the project and help us with public facing documentation. They are members of the research team and are reimbursed for their time and travel, according to INVOLVE guidance. Dissemination: Results of the study will be written-up for technical reporting and publication. Participants will be provided with a summary of results at the end of the study. The study team will be providing general updates on the progress of the study via their social media channels (e.g. Twitter @OnTrackRehab @ImperialIGHI @HelixCentre).",YES,Research With Clinical Staff in Stroke Rehabilitation,DEVICE: OnTrack Tools,"System Usability Scale (SUS), In systems engineering, the system usability scale (SUS) is a simple, ten-item attitude Likert scale giving a global view of subjective assessments of usability.

1 is ""strongly agree"" and 7 is ""strongly disagree""

Results are calculated by averaging the scores from the 7 points of the scale.

The PSSUQ has one overall score and 3 sub-scales, namely system usefulness, information quality, and interface quality scored as follows:

Overall: the average scores of questions 1 to 16 System Usefulness (SYSUSE): the average scores of questions 1 to 6 Information Quality (INFOQUAL): the average scores of questions 7 to 12 Interface Quality (INTERQUAL): the average scores of questions 13 to 15

The ovarian hormone estrogen is important for supporting normal cognitive function, and changes in brain activity and function occur when estrogen levels are decreased. Estrogen is also important for maintaining healthy blood vessels which also support normal cognitive function. In Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, there is significant damage to the blood vessels in the brain. This study will test whether changes in brain activity and function with the loss of estrogen are related to changes in vascular function. The investigators will measure vascular function using ultrasound, and brain activity using MRI scans in women who are enrolled in the Females, Aging, Metabolism and Exercise (FAME) study (NCT01712230).

NCT02856035,Novel Brain Signal Feedback Paradigm to Enhance Motor Learning After Stroke,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02856035,,COMPLETED,"Stroke (795,000/year in the US and 30 million existing stroke survivors in the world) damages brain neural structures that control coordinated upper limb movement. To most effectively target the brain damage, interventions should be directed so as to restore brain control serving coordination of peripheral neuromuscular function. Currently, there is a lack of a transformative intervention strategy, and only limited efficacy is seen in response to neural rehabilitation that is only peripherally-directed (limbs e.g.) or only directed at the brain. This study will employ a novel neural feedback approach with a closed-loop, real-time paradigm to engage and retrain existing brain function after stroke. Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMIR) provides neural feedback with the advantage of precisely identifying the location of brain activity for multiple cognitive and emotional tasks. However, the rtfMRI is costly and precludes motor learning that requires sitting and engaging the upper limb in complex motor tasks during imaging acquisition. In contrast, real-time functional near-infrared spectroscopy (rtfNIRS), although not as spatially precise as rtfMRI, offers a low-cost, portable solution to provide brain neural feedback during motor learning. This proposal will utilize both technologies in a hybrid, sequential motor learning protocol. Moreover, the study protocol will also simultaneously involve both central effective signals (through neural feedback) and peripheral affective signals by employing neutrally-triggered functional electrical stimulation (FES)-assisted coordination practice, which produces peripherally-induced affective signals from muscle and joint receptors. This novel combination intervention protocol will engage the central nervous system, motor effective pathway training along with induction of affective signal production (FES-assisted practice), all of which will be implemented within the framework of evidence-based motor learning principles.",YES,Stroke,OTHER: Neural feedback plus FES and motor training,"Arm Motor Abilities Test Functional Domain (AMAT - F), AMAT-F is a measure of 13 complex, coordinated tasks used in everyday living: functional normality of movement during the 13 tasks.

NCT04353076,Physiological Responses in Young and Older Adults During a Prolonged Simulated Heatwave,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04353076,HW1,COMPLETED,"Climate change not only affects the planet's natural resources, but also severely impacts human health. An individual's ability to adequately cope with short- or long-term increases in ambient temperature is critical for maintaining health and wellbeing. Prolonged increases in temperature (heatwaves) pose a serious health risk for older adults, who have a reduced capacity to efficiently regulate body temperature. However, information regarding the impact of age on body temperature regulation during prolonged exposure to extreme heat is lacking, as is research on the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing heat strain in such situations. This project will address these important knowledge gaps by exposing healthy young and older adults to a prolonged (9 hour) heat exposure, with conditions representative of heatwaves in temperate continental climates. An additional cohort of older adults will complete the same heatwave simulation but will be briefly (2 hours) exposed to cooler conditions (22-23°C) mid-way through the session (akin to visiting a cooling centre or cooled location). The investigators will evaluate age-related differences in the capacity to dissipate heat via direct air calorimetry (a unique device that permits the precise measurement of the heat dissipated by the human body) and their effect on the regulation of body temperature. The investigators anticipate that older adults will exhibit progressive increases in the heat stored in the body throughout the simulated heatwave, resulting in progressive increases in body core temperature. Further, older adults exposed to brief-mid day cooling will rapidly gain heat upon re-exposure to high ambient temperatures.

Identification of differences in the effects of exercise training on the integrated cardiovascular system and metabolism in men and women with and without T2DM will reveal specific adaptive responses to exercise.This study will evaluate \& compare exercise function in a total of 60 subjects from the Denver area (30 people with T2DM and 30 overweight control subjects).

Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that the integration of cardiac function, macrovascular function, and microvascular function is impaired in T2D and correlates with cardiovascular exercise capacity (CVEC) impairment.

Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that exercise training will elicit adaptive responses in cardiac and vascular function, muscle perfusion and metabolism with differences by T2D status.

Differences between the exercise responses in people with T2DM and healthy people will help further identify the disease process of T2DM and direct future research of treatments and interventions.",NO,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus|Healthy|Overweight|Cardiovascular Risk Factor,OTHER: Cardiovascular exercise training,"Change in peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), Subjects' peak oxygen consumption will be tested on a stationary bike before and after 3 months of exercise, Through study completion, approximately 4 months|Change in insulin sensitivity, The investigators will evaluate the changes in insulin sensitivity utilizing a euglycemic insulin clamp, Through study completion, approximately 4 months|Change in muscular mitochondrial function, The investigators will examine mitochondrial function using magnetic resistance (MR) spectroscopy during single leg calf exercise, Through study completion, approximately 4 months",,,"University of Colorado, Denver",VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System,ALL,ADULT,NA,124,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,17-0356,2018-02-07,2023-03-20,2023-03-20,2018-02-01,,2023-07-12,"University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States","Informed Consent Form, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/95/NCT03419195/ICF_001.pdf"
