## App codebase principles
1. Single Responsibility Principle: Each file will have a single responsibility
2. Reusable Components: Extract repeated UI patterns into reusable widgets
3. Simplified State Management: Implement proper state management
4. Improved Navigation: Centralize routing
5. Services: Extract business logic into service classes
