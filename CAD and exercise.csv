RHI measured by noninvasive endothelial peripheral arterial tomography (EndoPat) test.

Patients with moderate CKD have more than a two-fold increased risk of cognitive impairment than those without CKD; furthermore, as many as 20-70% of patients with CKD have established cognitive impairment and overt dementia. The burden of cognitive impairment and dementia leads to functional decline and accelerated loss of independence, contributing to the tremendous individual, societal, and economic burden of CKD (i.e., 20% of Medicare expenditures in adults \>65 years of age). There is no recommended treatment to prevent cognitive decline in CKD patients, and the few medications available for cognitive impairment have only short term modest effects.

This composite includes : Flanker, Dimensional Change Card Sort, Picture Sequence Memory, List Sorting and Pattern Comparison. This composite score is derived by averaging the standard scores of each of the measures, and then deriving standard scores based on this new distribution. An Age-Corrected Standard Score was used.

An larger change from baseline to 6 months is considered an improvement. Scale runs 140 to 23, a higher score means a better outcome., Mean change from baseline to 6 months.|Motor Function - Balance, Determine the effect of a 6-month exercise program on motor function via the NIH toolbox. Change in balance age corrected standard score from baseline to 6-months (23-140, higher score is better). A larger change is considered an improvement., 6 Months|Motor Function - Dexterity, Determine the effect of a 6-month exercise program on motor function via the NIH toolbox. Hand dexterity was determine using age corrected standard scale in the dominant hand. A larger change from baseline to 6 months is considered an improvement.

Standard scale range 140-23, higher score is better., 6 Months|Resting Global Connectivity, Resting global connectivity measured and averaged across 132 regions. A larger change from baseline to 6 months is considered an improvement. Connectivity is a correlation (increased connectivity=higher correlation), Change from baseline at 6 months|Hippocampal Volume - Left, Determine the effect of a 6-month exercise program on hippocampal volume. An larger change from baseline to 6 months in left hippocampal volume (cubic millimeters) is considered an improvement., Change from baseline at 6 Months",,University of Illinois at Chicago,Midwest Roybal Center for Health Promotion and Translation|National Institute on Aging (NIA),ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,39,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2016-1217|P30AG022849,01-09-2017,26-11-2019,18-12-2019,23-06-2017,06-01-2021,02-07-2021,"University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, 60612, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/38/NCT03197038/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"
