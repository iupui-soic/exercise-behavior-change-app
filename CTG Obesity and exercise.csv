A culturally matched family connector will create linkages among the settings to support parents in making home environment and parenting behavior changes conducive to healthy growth and development in their children.

Specific Aim 1 To evaluate the effects of a three-year multi-setting parent-targeted randomized controlled intervention on the primary outcome, child BMI, compared to a standard primary care-only intervention among 500 low income ethnic minority two to four year old children who are at or above the 50th percentile of BMI for age and gender.

Hypothesis 1: Children in the multi-setting parent-targeted intervention will have a lower BMI at 24 and 36 months, compared with children in the standard primary care only control group.

Specific Aim 2 To evaluate the effects of a three-year multi-setting parent-targeted intervention on secondary outcomes, including change in child energy intake and physical activity energy expenditure, compared to a standard primary care-only intervention.

Hypothesis 2: Children in the multi-setting parent-targeted intervention will have lower energy intake and higher energy expenditure over the three-year period, compared with children in the standard primary care-only control group.

Specific Aim 3 To evaluate the effects of the multi-setting parent-targeted intervention on hypothesized mediators of change in dietary intake, physical activity, and BMI.

NCT01977417,Inflammation Inhibition in Prediabetic Humans,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01977417,INCITE,TERMINATED,"Prediabetes, characterized by elevated fasting blood sugar or exaggerated blood sugar response to sugar ingestion, effects over 79 million adult Americans and is a precursor to the development of Type 2 diabetes. Importantly, approximately 42% of Iowans (950,000) have diabetes and 32% (670,000) have prediabetes with the majority of those with prediabetes going undiagnosed. Adults with prediabetes demonstrate early signs of cardiovascular and nervous system abnormalities and are at high risk for developing overt diabetes unless aggressive lifestyle (weight loss, exercise) or pharmacological interventions are employed. Interestingly, data in recent years has linked obesity and diabetes to chronic inflammation of the blood vessels and brain areas that regulate blood pressure. Therefore, the current study will test whether a commonly used aspirin-like anti-inflammatory drug called salsalate, will improve blood vessel health and nervous system dysfunction in adults with prediabetes. Eligible subjects will have measurements of blood pressure, blood vessel function in the arms and eyes, assessments of nerve activity, and blood samples taken before and after 4 weeks of ingesting an FDA approved aspirin-like drug called salsalate. The study is important because it will identify a potentially new pharmacological strategy to treat vascular and nervous system abnormalities in overweight and obese adults with early stage type 2 diabetes using an inexpensive, generically available drug with an excellent safety record that has been used for decades to treat chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. If proven effective, this will provide preliminary support for the concept of targeting inflammation as a new clinical approach to treating early diabetes related complications. Furthermore, the current pilot study will provide support for developing a larger clinical trial using salsalate that could potentially then be extended to patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, as well as lead to the development of new anti-inflammatory agents with greater specificity for selective inflammatory pathways.",YES,Prediabetes|Obese,DRUG: Salsalate|DRUG: Placebo,"Aim 1: Vascular Endothelial Function in Obese Prediabetic Adults Before and After 1 Month of Salsalate or Placebo., Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, Change from baseline at 4 weeks",,,Gary L.

NCT03239782,"The ""Metabolically-obese Normal-weight"" Phenotype and Its Reversal by Calorie Restriction",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03239782,,COMPLETED,"The prevalence of overweight and obesity in Singapore is approximately half of that in the United States, yet the incidence of type 2 diabetes is similar, and is expected to double in the near future. This indicates that metabolic dysfunction, particularly insulin resistance, is widely prevalent even among individuals who are considered normal-weight or lean by conventional measures, i.e. body mass index (BMI) and percent body fat. These individuals are often referred to as ""metabolically-obese normal-weight"" (MONW), and have increased risk for cardiometabolic disease despite their normal BMI and total body fat values. The prevalence of the MONW phenotype varies across populations and differs markedly among different ethnicities. However, our understanding of the complex interactions between ethnicity, body composition, and metabolic dysfunction and its reversal remains rudimentary. Previous attempts to characterize the MONW phenotype are confounded by the small but significant differences in BMI or percent body fat between groups (even if all subjects were lean, within the ""normal"" range), with MONW subjects being always ""fatter"" than the corresponding control subjects. There are no published studies that prospectively recruited groups of metabolically healthy and unhealthy lean individuals matched on BMI and percent body fat. Furthermore, although weight loss improves body composition and many of the cardiometabolic abnormalities in most obese patients, little is known about the possible therapeutic effects of calorie restriction in MONW subjects.

Accordingly, a better understanding of the MONW phenotype and the evaluation of therapeutic approaches for its reversal will have important implications for public health. By facilitating earlier identification of these subjects, who are more likely to go undiagnosed and thus less likely to be treated before clinically overt cardiometabolic disease develops, results from this study will allow for earlier and effective intervention.",NO,"Glucose Metabolism Disorders|Obesity, Visceral|Obesity; Endocrine|Insulin Sensitivity/Resistance",BEHAVIORAL: Calorie restriction,"Whole-body insulin sensitivity, Our primary endpoint is whole-body insulin sensitivity (i.e. the major metabolic correlate of the MONW phenotype), determined by using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp., 3 hours",,,"Clinical Nutrition Research Centre, Singapore",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,77,OTHER_GOV,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,MONW,29-03-2016,07-10-2017,07-10-2017,04-08-2017,,13-03-2018,,"Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/82/NCT03239782/Prot_SAP_000.pdf|Informed Consent Form, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/82/NCT03239782/ICF_001.pdf"

Although it has long been realized that Western diets that are rich in sugar and fat play an important role in this, it has only recently been realized that exposure to these diets, particularly in childhood, can damage the part of the brain that determines how much fat there is in the body. The result of this damage is that the so-called ""set-point"" for fat in this part of the brain is pushed upwards. There is a lot of evidence from animals that activating the brain's balance (vestibular) system pushes this set-point for fat downwards to cause fat loss, probably because this ""tricks"" the brain into thinking that there is increased physical activity. The aim of this study is to see whether non-invasive electrical stimulation of the vestibular system in human participants causes a change in metabolism of fat and/or energy expenditure, which, if regulated upwards, would suggest this could be used as a means of reducing body fat in humans.",YES,Obesity|Metabolic Syndrome,DEVICE: Vestibular Nerve Stimulator|DEVICE: Sham stimulator,"Change in Fat Consumption (During VeNS), Change in percent fat utilization from baseline as measured using indirect calorimetry., During middle 15 minutes of 45 minute vestibular nerve stimulation session","Change in Energy Expenditure (During VeNS), Change in energy expenditure from baseline in kcal/min as measured using indirect calorimetry., During middle 15 minutes of 45 minute vestibular nerve stimulation session",,"University of California, San Diego",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,20,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE",170798,25-08-2017,01-03-2018,01-03-2018,03-05-2017,21-05-2019,27-06-2019,"UC San Diego, San Diego, California, 92093, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/82/NCT03138382/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"

NCT04621045,Active You: Feasibility of a Unique Physical Activity Program to Prevent Diabetes and Heart Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04621045,,COMPLETED,"Individuals who are overweight/obese are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes (T2D). Current evidence suggests that PA, even without dietary prescription, can be efficacious in preventing T2D. Yet most Americans, especially those who are overweight/obese, are not physically active. Socioenvironmental barriers to physical activity (PA) such as body image concerns and limited access to fitness facilities contribute to the low levels of PA observed in overweight/obese adults. Web-based PA programs have been developed to address these barriers, but the outcomes have been marginal. Qualitative studies suggest that individuals who are overweight/obese prefer PA programs that feature people they can relate to especially in body size, fitness status and age. Previously, the investigators have included these preferences in a technology-based Physical Activity for The Heart (PATH) intervention that leverages open source platforms, such as YouTube, to promote PA in any setting. In this application, the investigators propose to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of PATH in promoting PA and reducing cardiometabolic risk in adults who are overweight/obese and at high risk of diabetes. In Aim 1 the investigators will conduct a 12-week randomized clinical trial including 52 adults who are overweight/obese and at high risk of diabetes to assess the feasibility and acceptability of PATH. In Aim 2 investigators will examine the trend in PA and cardiometabolic risk change from baseline to post-intervention. This approach is innovative because it leverages open source technologies to provide low-cost, action-oriented PA resources that match the preferences of adults who are overweight/obese. This contribution will be significant because PATH could offer a convenient, enjoyable and scalable program that features ""similar others"" to promote PA in overweight/obese adults at high risk of diabetes.",NO,Cardiovascular Risk Factor|Prediabetes|Overweight and Obesity|Sedentary Behavior,BEHAVIORAL: The Physical Activity for The Heart (PATH) intervention|BEHAVIORAL: Be Active Your Way Booklet,"Recruitment feasibility, Will be indicated by ability to recruit, screen, and enroll the target sample within 6 months of commencing recruitment, and retention of ≥80% of the sample., At the end of study approximately 48 weeks after commencement of the study|Feasibility of self-monitoring step count using wrist worn ActiGraph GT9X, will be indicated by the proportion of the sample with ≥4days per week of valid Actigraph wear time (≥10hrs) during the entire course of the study., At the end of study approximately 52 weeks after commencement of the study|Acceptability of PATH intervention, Will be indicated by utilization data that will be collected via Web analytics, and a post-intervention survey will assess the intervention acceptability., At the end of study approximately 52 weeks after commencement of the study","Change from baseline in body mass index (BMI) at 12 weeks, BMI will be measured using Fitbit Aria II scale provided to the participant by the study team.

NCT03982511,Improving Parent-Child Interactions to Enhance Child Health,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03982511,PCIT-Health,COMPLETED,"Childhood obesity is a formidable public health issue in the United States, disproportionately affecting children from lower socioeconomic status households. Onset of obesity predicts cardiometabolic risks and other health problems in adolescence and into adulthood; thus, effective and early prevention is critical. Healthy parenting may play a pivotal role in preventing early childhood obesity. Warm, responsive, and consistent parenting is associated with the development of child self-regulation as well as healthy eating and physical activity practices, and thus may be protective against obesity risk. Targeting the parent-child relationship may be especially important when facilitating behavior change in parents who have ongoing stressors (e.g., low-income families). The proposed study aims to test an adaptation of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), an innovative parent management program that improves the parent-child relationship and enhances general parenting skills through the use of therapeutic in vivo coaching. Our adapted version, PCIT-Health, is a selective-prevention intervention that includes content specific to improving parent-child interactions and parenting in obesity-salient contexts, such as mealtime and child screen time. This project will elucidate novel approaches to, and novel targets of, early childhood obesity prevention and will provide data critical to test PCIT-Health in a large-scale randomized controlled trial. Parent-child dyads will be randomly assigned to PCIT-Health or a waitlist control in order to accomplish the following aims: AIM 1: To assess the acceptability and feasibility of the PCIT-Health delivery and assessment methods in low-income parents of overweight young children ages 3 to 6 years. AIM 2: To test the preliminary efficacy and estimate the effect size of PCIT-Health on changes in child BMI z-score (primary outcome) from baseline to (1) intervention completion and (2) 6-month post-intervention. AIM 3: To explore the effect of PCIT-Health on the following secondary outcomes: (1) parent-child relationship quality, (2) parent behavior management skills, (3) child self-regulation, (4) child eating behaviors, (5) child physical activity, and (6) child screen media use.",YES,Child Obesity,BEHAVIORAL: PCIT-Health,"Change in Child Body Mass Index (BMI) Percentile, Change in child BMI percentile will be calculated using standardized anthropometric measurement (height and weight) procedure, Pre-intervention (T1), post-intervention (T2;4 months after pre-intervention), and six-month follow-up (T3;10 months after pre-intervention)|Change in Child Body Mass Index (BMI) Z-score, Change in child BMI z-score will be calculated using standardized anthropometric measurement (height and weight) procedure.

NCT02880540,Dexmedetomidine to Treat Bariatric Surgery-associated Pain,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02880540,,COMPLETED,"Obesity represents one of the most important public health issues according to the World Health Organization and it has reached epidemic proportions globally. The prevalence of childhood obesity has rapidly increased over the past decade and is associated with multiple co-morbid disease states . It is estimated that approximately 15.5% of children and adolescents are obese with a body mass index of ≥95th percentile for age . This not only poses health concerns for the patient, but also places increased demands on our healthcare system that is already overwhelmed by burgeoning costs. Moreover, obese children and adolescents who maintain excessive weight as adults are predisposed to cardiovascular disease and premature death.

In carefully selected patients who have failed to lose weight by diet and exercise, bariatric surgery provides an option to obtaining a healthy weight.

It is increasingly becoming an attractive option, with the number of adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery in the United States tripling between 2000 and 2003.

Obese patients are often afflicted with multi-organ dysfunction and obstructive sleep apnea, which presents unique challenges to the anesthesiologist managing their perioperative care . Bariatric surgery in obese adolescents may be associated with significant postoperative pain. Potent intravenous opioids such as fentanyl and morphine are at the mainstay of perioperative pain management. Unfortunately, respiratory depression and airway obstruction can often occur following administration of opioids in obese patients . This makes providing a safe analgesic regimen difficult during the perioperative setting. As opioids can be associated with respiratory depression and upper airway obstruction, surgeons and anesthesiologists alike must reconcile the adequacy of pain control with the risk of respiratory complications after surgery in obese adolescents.",YES,Obesity,DRUG: Fentanyl|DRUG: Morphine|DRUG: Dexmedetomidine,"Pain Scores (Numerical Rating Scale 0-10) Using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised, Average pain scores during the day of surgery using the FPS-R rates pain on a scale from 1-10, with 0 representing ""no pain"" and 10 ""very much pain.

It utilizes games and activities to educate children about healthy eating, portion control/size and exercise. It allows for food tracking by using servings of macronutrients and food groups and sets goals for achieving a healthy BMI through modification of diet intake. In addition to being created solely for children and adolescents, a unique feature of this app is an option to speak with a personal health coach on a regular basis to obtain feedback, advice and encouragement. Studies suggest that weight loss outcomes are best with more frequent contact hours but most weight loss clinics, including ours, are not equipped to meet with patients on a weekly basis or even monthly basis. The personal coaching aspect of Kurbo is expected to improve outcomes by increasing user access to feedback and advice.

The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility, compliance with and effects of a pediatric centered weight loss app on BMI z-scores in a group of children and adolescents in a pediatric weight management program. The investigators will assess the impact of the app as an adjunct to current weight management therapy, both with and without the personal health coach (PHC) option.",YES,Obesity,DEVICE: Kurbo|DEVICE: Personal Health Coach,"3 Month Compliance With the Kurbo App as Well as the Kurbo App and PHC by a Group of Morbidly Obese Children and Adolescents in a Weight Management Program., A questionnaire will be handed out to each subject every month (see below) where applicable.we will utilize one-sample tests with a one-sided alpha of 0.025.

NCT04772859,Evaluation of an Online Lifestyle Intervention in Mexican School Children During COVID-19 Pandemic,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04772859,,COMPLETED,"Introduction: School closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic represent a risk factor for the development of childhood obesity due to the increase in unhealthy behaviors. Online lifestyle interventions in schoolchildren could help to mitigate this problem. However, to date, no randomized controlled trials have been performed to prevent obesity in schoolchildren during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a 4-month online lifestyle intervention on the BMI Z-score of Mexican schoolchildren during the COVID-19 pandemic in an intervention group compared to a control group. Methodology: This is a pilot randomized controlled trial. Schoolchildren from a public elementary school in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico will be invited to participate. Participants will be randomized to an intervention group (online lifestyle intervention) or a control group. The intervention will include online sessions of nutrition education and physical activity and nutrition information for parents. The control group will receive a digital brochure with nutrition recommendations at the beginning of the study. The measurements will be performed at baseline and 4 months. The primary outcome will be the BMI Z- score. Secondary outcomes: waist circumference, fat percentage, nutritional knowledge, lifestyle parameters, retention, attendance at the program sessions, and acceptability of the intervention. The difference between groups in changes in the outcomes will be analyzed using an intention to treat analysis. The protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Sonora Nursing Department (EPM-003-2020).

The 8-week intervention was designed to improve several key social mechanisms within ASPs overlooked in previous interventions (e.g., developing friendship and connection to peers and staff through PA; group belonging, including positive peer PA norms and tangible support) that are key predictors of youth PA and included: 1) ""Get to know you"" sessions aimed at providing youth guided social opportunities to foster friendship-building skills, and to promote acceptance, cooperation, contribution, and friendship affiliation, and; 2) a novel socially-oriented physical activity curriculum tailored to meet the social goals and needs of program staff and participating youth. Comparison of ASPs receiving the 8-week ""Connect"" intervention (N=3 ASPs) with ASPs randomized to receive the general ASP curriculum (wait-list control condition; N=3 ASPs) will yield preliminary data on the effectiveness of social mediators for improving moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and preventing obesity among at-risk youth that can inform future intervention design and youth programming policy. Results of this proposed project will provide the basis for conducting a large scale efficacy trial.

In the investigator's previously funded studies, the investigators demonstrated for the first time that: 1) in vivo ROS were elevated in skeletal muscle of obese as compared to lean or overweight human subjects, 2) perfusion of the NADPH-oxidase inhibitor apocynin locally into muscle normalized ROS levels and reversed local microvascular endothelial dysfunction in the obese individuals, and 3) aerobic exercise training was effective at attenuating in vivo hydrogen peroxide production and reversing microvascular endothelial dysfunction in the obese individuals. The investigators will investigate in this R15 renewal application the mechanism of exercise training-induced alterations in ROS production and action on endothelial dysfunction in obesity using our newly developed microdialysis methodology of monitoring ROS production, in combination with analysis of muscle biopsy samples obtained before and after our previously tested 8-week intervention of aerobic interval exercise training. The objectives of this study are to determine the impact of in vivo NADPH oxidase activity on endothelial function in obese individuals, and to determine the mechanism of training-induced improvements in endothelial function. The investigator's unique microdialysis methodology will allow monitoring of microvascular/endothelial function and ROS generation, as well as the administration of pharmacological agents directly into muscle. The central hypothesis is that it is upregulation of both mitochondrial ROS and NADPH oxidase-derived ROS that results in endothelial dysfunction in obesity, and that exercise training down-regulates mitochondrial-derived ROS, and NADPH oxidase 4, thereby improving endothelial function. The aims of this proposal are to: 1) determine the contributions of mitochondrial ROS and specific NADPH oxidase isoforms to the NADPH oxidase dependent endothelial dysfunction in skeletal muscle of obese individuals; 2) determine the mechanism of ROS reduction and improved endothelial function resulting from an 8-week aerobic interval training program.",NO,Obesity|Endothelial Dysfunction,BEHAVIORAL: Exercise,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive oxygen species as indicated by H2O2 concentration measured with microdialysis, change from week 0 to week 8","Muscle blood flow, muscle microvascular blood flow as monitored with microdialysis, change from week 0 to week 8",,Florida State University,,ALL,ADULT,NA,25,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,R15HL113854,20-11-2019,31-05-2024,31-07-2024,12-09-2019,,07-07-2023,"Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida, 32306, United States","Study Protocol, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/55/NCT04087655/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/55/NCT04087655/SAP_001.pdf"

NCT05895916,Extreme Exercise and Energy Expenditure (4E) Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05895916,,COMPLETED,"The goal of this clinical trial is to provide evidence, through an extreme exercise prescription (1,144 km of road cycling on seven consecutive days), that weight loss is not the appropriate outcome to evaluate the effects of exercise on abdominal adiposity and ectopic fat depots (e.g. liver fat and epi/pericardial fat) in eleven recreational middle-aged male cyclists (aged 50 to 66 years) without symptoms of cardiovascular disease. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* If energy intake is substantially increased to compensate energy expenditure and prevent weight loss following an extreme exercise prescription, will significant changes in body composition and body fat distribution be observed?
* Will these changes translate into improvements in the cardiometabolic health profile even in the absence of weight loss?

Participants will be asked to partake in several evaluations: fasting plasma lipoprotein-lipid profile and inflammation markers, glycated hemoglobin, cardiorespiratory fitness, submaximal exercise test including measurement of energy expenditure, resting and exercise blood pressure and heart rate, evaluation of regional adiposity, liver fat content, epi/pericardial fat, nutritional quality, and level of physical activity. After baseline evaluations, participants will be asked to alternately bike 208 km and 104 km per day on a pre-specified course for seven consecutive days. They will be accompanied during each of the seven bike rides by research professionals in a recreational vehicle. Participants' weight, body composition and waist circumference will be measured under standardized conditions in the morning after an overnight fast and after the exercise. Their heart rate will be continuously monitored, and participants will wear accelerometers to estimate their daily exercise-related energy expenditure. Foods and fluids will be provided to participants and recorded. At the end of the 1,144 km/ 7-days bike ride, baseline evaluations will be repeated with the exception of the maximal exercise treadmill test, nutritional quality, and level of physical activity.

NCT04122716,Combined Effects of GLP-1 Analogue and Exercise on Maintenance of Weight Loss and Health After Very-low Calorie Diet,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04122716,S-LITE,UNKNOWN,"Introduction: The success rate of weight loss maintenance is limited. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the maintenance of weight loss and immunometabolic health outcomes after diet-induced weight loss followed by one-year treatment with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (liraglutide), physical exercise, or the combination of both treatments as compared with placebo in individuals with obesity.

Methods and analysis: This is an investigator-initiated, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial. The investigators will enroll women and men (age 18 to 65 years) with obesity (body mass index 32 to 43 kg/m2) to adhere to a very low-calorie diet (800 kcal/day) for eight weeks in order to lose at least 5 % of body weight. Subsequently, participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of four study groups for 52 weeks: 1) placebo, 2) exercise 150 min/week + placebo, 3) liraglutide 3.0 mg/day, and 4) exercise 150 min/week + liraglutide 3.0 mg/day. Re-screening is allowed within the recruitment period.

The primary endpoint is change in body weight from randomization to end-of-treatment.

Ethics and dissemination: The trial has been approved by the ethical committee of the Capital Region of Denmark (H-16027082) and the Danish Medicines Agency (EudraCT 2015-005585-32).

NCT01862029,Effects of Roflumilast on Insulin and Blood Sugar Levels in Prediabetic Overweight and Obese Individuals,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01862029,,COMPLETED,"Background:

- Roflumilast is a drug used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is designed to help reduce lung inflammation. However, during testing, roflumilast also appeared to reduce high blood sugar levels in people with COPD and type 2 diabetes. Other tests showed that roflumilast also improved blood sugar levels in people who only had type 2 diabetes. Researchers want to see how roflumilast affects insulin and blood sugar levels in overweight or obese people who are not diabetic, but who have high blood sugar levels.

Objectives:

- To see how well roflumilast improves blood sugar and insulin levels in prediabetic overweight or obese individuals.

Eligibility:

- Individuals between 30 to 65 years old who are overweight or obese (body mass index of 24.9 to 39.9 kg/m2) and have elevated blood sugar levels.

Design:

* This study will last approximately 8 weeks. Participants will have approximately five study visits over about 7 weeks. Two of these visits will be overnight inpatient stays.
* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected. They will also have a 3-day diet and exercise assessment with a dietitian.
* In Week 1, participants will have a special diet for 2 days to keep their regular weight. They will then have a 2-day inpatient stay. During their stay, they will have multiple tests, including blood sugar tests and full body scans. They may provide a fat and muscle tissue biopsy sample. They will then receive the study drug to take during the study.
* In Week 2, participants will repeat the diet study from the screening visit. They will receive a different dose of the study drug.
* In Week 3, participants will review their diet results and have blood and urine tests.
* In Week 5, participants will repeat the diet and exercise study from the screening visit.
* In Week 6, participants will repeat the inpatient studies and tests from Week 1.

NCT03077360,Skeletal Muscle Diacylglycerol and Sphingolipids - Impact of Localization and Species on Insulin Resistance in Humans,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03077360,,COMPLETED,"The rationale for the proposed research is that elucidating changes in localized diacylglycerol (DAG) and sphingolipid species that predict insulin sensitivity will reveal specific localized lipids to target in therapeutics for type 2 diabetes. To attain the overall objective, the investigators propose three specific aims: 1. Identify the influence of sarcolemmal DAG and sphingolipids on cell signaling and insulin sensitivity before and after insulin sensitizing lifestyle interventions. Strong preliminary data shape the hypothesis that sarcolemmal 1,2-disaturated DAG and C18:0 ceramide species will decrease after insulin sensitizing lifestyle interventions, leading to less Protein kinase C (PKC) and Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activation, and enhanced insulin signaling. Skeletal muscle DAG and sphingolipid isomers, species, localization, and de novo synthesis will be measured before and after diet-induced weight loss or exercise training interventions in obese men and women. Insulin sensitivity will be measured using insulin clamps, and muscle lipids using Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS). 2. Determine the impact of mitochondrial/ER (endoplasmic reticulum) DAG and sphingolipids on mitochondrial function and ER stress in vivo, before and after insulin sensitizing lifestyle interventions. The investigators hypothesize, again based on preliminary data, that mitochondrial/ER sphingolipids will decrease, yet DAG will increase after insulin sensitizing lifestyle interventions, and each will associate with increased insulin sensitivity. Changes in sphingolipids will relate to increased mitochondrial function, less ER stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and acyl-carnitine formation, while changes in DAG will relate to increased mitochondrial content and dynamics. 3. Identify the effect of exogenous DAG and sphingolipids on mitochondrial function in vitro, before and after insulin sensitizing lifestyle interventions. The working hypothesis is that DAG and sphingolipids will reduce mitochondrial respiration and increase ROS and acyl-carnitine content, but will be attenuated after endurance exercise training. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantive departure from the status quo by addressing cellular compartmentalization of bioactive lipids. The investigators contribution will be significant by identifying key species and locations of DAG and sphingolipids promoting insulin resistance, as well as mechanisms explaining accumulation that could be modified by insulin sensitizing therapeutic interventions.",YES,"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2|Pre-diabetes|Obesity",BEHAVIORAL: Lifestyle,"Percent Change in Insulin Sensitivity Compared to Baseline Measurement., Hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic clamp measured as glucose infusion rate in mg/kg/min., Baseline and 12 weeks|Percent Change in Localized Muscle Lipids Compared to Baseline, We measured changes in sarcolemmal, mitochondrial, nuclear and cytosolic lipids measured in pmol/ug protein after compared to before the interventions, Baseline and 12 weeks|Percent Change in Body Weight Compared to Baseline Measurement, This is the percent change in body weight for each group after the 12 week intervention., Baseline, 3 Months",,,"University of Colorado, Denver",National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK),ALL,ADULT,NA,62,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,16-1404|5R01DK111559,01-02-2017,19-11-2020,19-11-2020,10-03-2017,06-01-2022,21-06-2022,"University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/60/NCT03077360/Prot_SAP_000.pdf|Informed Consent Form, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/60/NCT03077360/ICF_001.pdf"

NCT05710653,Inter-individual Physiological Response to a Training and Detraining Period in Cardiometabolic Risk Factors Subjects,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05710653,VASCU-HEALTH,RECRUITING,"Background: Although exercise training is a well described therapy for some cardiometabolic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension, and metabolic syndrome, there is scarcity of knowledge about the post-exercise period term as 'detraining' where usually all physiological adaptations as cardiovascular and metabolic benefits are lost due to physical inactivity. Likewise, as some exercise training modalities as high-intensity interval training improve vascular parameters including endothelial dysfunction parameters as flow-mediated dilation (FMD%), and carotid-intima media thickness (c-IMT) during the 'training' period, there is little knowledge about how many 'volume' or 'intensity' of exercise training or physical activity per week is needed to maintain the exercise training benefits in populations with cardiometabolic risk factors such as those patients with arterial hypertension. This information will be of great interest for both improving and maintaining the vascular profile and health of Chilean adults with risk factors and to maintain a better vascular profile. Objective: To study the beneficial adaptations from the 'training' and 'detraining' period of exercise training on functional and structural vascular parameters in healthy and cardiometabolic risk factors adult subjects to improve the health profile. Methods: The investigators will conduct an experimental design of 5 groups of exercise training in healthy (controls) and hypertensive (HTN) patients (≥140 mmHg), with overweight/or obesity, men and women, with BMI ≥25 and ≤35 kg/m2, aged ≥18y, physically inactive (\<150 min/week of low/moderate PA/week, or \<75 min/week of vigorous PA) in the last 6 months will be invited for participating.

NCT01251887,Dietary Essential Fatty Acid Regulation of Omega-3 HUFA Metabolism; Satiety and Body Composition,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01251887,,COMPLETED,"Background:

- Rates of obesity have increased dramatically in recent decades, and researchers are investigating how changes in diets and physical activity have contributed to this increase. To understand how weight might be controlled, it is important to learn what kinds of dietary changes can affect hunger and might lower body weight. Essential fatty acids, for instance, are an important part of a healthy diet, but researchers have not yet determined the ideal amount of essential fatty acids that people should eat. By studying how different diets affect body chemistry and hormone levels in women who are overweight or obese, researchers hope to be able to determine better diets or treatments to help people reach and maintain an optimum healthy weight.

Objectives:

- To examine how certain fats in the diet affect body metabolism, hormones, and weight regulation.

Eligibility:

- Healthy women between 18 and 50 years of age who are overweight or obese (body mass index between 25 and 35).

Design:

* This study has an initial screening visit and three phases. All participants will be involved in the first two phases of the study, and some participants will be involved in the third phase.
* Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, in addition to blood and urine tests and questionnaires about eating habits and other diet factors.
* Phase 1: Participants will have three visits to the National Institutes of Health over a 4-week period. At the visits, participants will have blood and urine tests, complete questionnaires, and have other tests including brain and body imaging studies. Participants will then be assigned to one of three study diets.
* Phase 2: Participants will have a 12-week diet phase, with all foods supplied by the study researchers. Participants will keep a daily log of food and beverage intake, and will have three testing sessions with procedures similar to those performed in Phase 1.
* Phase 3: Participants assigned to a particular study diet (one-third of all participants) will be given the option of continuing the diet for an additional 36 weeks (9 months), with food consumption, monitoring, and testing procedures similar to those performed in Phase 2....",YES,Weight Gain|Healthy Subjects|Obesity|Women,DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Linoleic Acid|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Docosahexaenoic Acid|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Eicosapentaenoic Acid,"Proportion of n-6 HUFA in Total HUFA (%n-6 in HUFA), Tissue accretion of omega-6 (n-6) highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) in fasting plasma as percent of total HUFA., Baseline|Proportion of n-6 HUFA in Total HUFA (%n-6 in HUFA), Tissue accretion of omega-6 (n-6) highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) in fasting plasma as percent of total HUFA., Week 4|Proportion of n-6 HUFA in Total HUFA (%n-6 in HUFA), Tissue accretion of omega-6 (n-6) highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) in fasting plasma as percent of total HUFA., Week 8|Proportion of n-6 HUFA in Total HUFA (%n-6 in HUFA), Tissue accretion of omega-6 (n-6) highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) in fasting plasma as percent of total HUFA., Week 12","Proportion of n-6 HUFA Arachidonic Acid (AA), Tissue accretion of Arachidonic Acid (AA or 20:4n6), an omega-6 (n-6) highly unsaturated fatty acid, as measured in fasting plasma as a percent of total fatty acids., Baseline|Proportion of n-6 HUFA Arachidonic Acid (AA), Tissue accretion of Arachidonic Acid (AA or 20:4n6), an omega-6 (n-6) highly unsaturated fatty acid, as measured in fasting plasma as a percent of total fatty acids., Week 4|Proportion of n-6 HUFA Arachidonic Acid (AA), Tissue accretion of Arachidonic Acid (AA or 20:4n6), an omega-6 (n-6) highly unsaturated fatty acid, as measured in fasting plasma as a percent of total fatty acids., Week 8|Proportion of n-6 HUFA Arachidonic Acid (AA), Tissue accretion of Arachidonic Acid (AA or 20:4n6), an omega-6 (n-6) highly unsaturated fatty acid, as measured in fasting plasma as a percent of total fatty acids., Week 12|Proportion of n-3 HUFA Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA), Tissue accretion of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA or 20:5n3), an omega-3 (n-3) highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA), as measured in fasting plasma as a percent of total fatty acids., Baseline|Proportion of n-3 HUFA Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA), Tissue accretion of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA or 20:5n3), an omega-3 (n-3) highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA), as measured in fasting plasma as a percent of total fatty acids., Week 4|Proportion of n-3 HUFA Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA), Tissue accretion of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA or 20:5n3), an omega-3 (n-3) highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA), as measured in fasting plasma as a percent of total fatty acids., Week 8|Proportion of n-3 HUFA Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA), Tissue accretion of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA or 20:5n3), an omega-3 (n-3) highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA), as measured in fasting plasma as a percent of total fatty acids., Week 12|Proportion of n-3 HUFA Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA), Tissue accretion of Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA or 22:6n3), an omega-3 (n-3) highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA), as measured in fasting plasma as a percent of total fatty acids., Baseline|Proportion of n-3 HUFA Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA), Tissue accretion of Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA or 22:6n3), an omega-3 (n-3) highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA), as measured in fasting plasma as a percent of total fatty acids., Week 4|Proportion of n-3 HUFA Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA), Tissue accretion of Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA or 22:6n3), an omega-3 (n-3) highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA), as measured in fasting plasma as a percent of total fatty acids., Week 8|Proportion of n-3 HUFA Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA), Tissue accretion of Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA or 22:6n3), an omega-3 (n-3) highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA), as measured in fasting plasma as a percent of total fatty acids., Week 12",,National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA),,FEMALE,ADULT,NA,85,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: |Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,110028|11-AA-0028,12-11-2010,25-07-2018,25-07-2018,02-12-2010,06-08-2021,05-09-2021,"National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/87/NCT01251887/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"

Resting energy expenditure and 24-hour energy expenditure vary substantially between individuals. In some cases, relatively reduced rates of 24h EE predict weight gain in some populations who have high prevalence of obesity. Obese individuals that lose weight experience a decrease in 24-h EE and resting energy expenditure that is lower than predicted based on changes in body composition. Most weight loss studies have found a large individual variation in the amount of weight change, and whether an individual's response to an intervention can be predicted is not clear. Measurements of 24-hour EE in response to fasting may help predict weight loss. The ECAL indirect calorimeter (ECAL) is a validated device purpose-built to provide the practitioner and patient with energy information that allows for more accurate, reliable method of establishing an obese individuals' metabolic profile.

Studies have suggested that eating later in the evening or at night when the circadian system is promoting sleep adversely influences weight loss.

The overall objective of this proposal is to provide a foundation to inform the design of a future large-scale trial to evaluate the efficacy of TRF in generating weight loss. The investigators aims are to: 1) Assess processes critical for the success of a large-scale trial comparing the efficacy of a reduced calorie diet with time restricted feeding (RCD+TRF) versus standard RCD on weight loss; 2) Develop methodology to assess compliance to the RCD+TRF versus standard RCD program and collect preliminary data on whether the programs have differential effects on free-living behaviors (EI, appetite, physical activity, and sedentary behavior); and 3) Measure metabolic responses to RCD+TRF versus standard RCD to determine candidate mechanisms related to weight loss at 12wks and weight maintenance at 6mo post-intervention.

NCT03648892,Brain Dopamine Function in Human Obesity,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03648892,,COMPLETED,"Background:

Dopamine is a natural chemical in the brain that may influence eating behavior and physical activity. Researchers want to measure the brain s dopamine activity and understand how it differs in people with obesity.

Objective:

To better understand how brain function, particularly dopamine activity, relates to body weight and eating behavior.

Individuals may be able to participate if they:

Have a BMI of at least 18.5 kg/m2

Are weight-stable and generally healthy

Are between ages 18-45 years

Have normal blood pressure

Are not using illegal drugs (based on urine drug screen)

Are not following a special diet

Do not have metal implants

Design:

Participants will be screened with:

* Medical history
* Physical exam
* Questionnaires and an interview to see if it is safe to have a PET/MRI scan
* Fasting blood and urine tests
* Participants will eat a special diet given to them for the 5 days before their inpatient visit.

Participants will have a 5-day inpatient visit. Some days include blood and urine tests. Each day includes surveys and tests to measure habits and likes/dis-likes. A sample schedule may be:

Day 1: Participants will wear a monitor that uses a needle below the skin to measure glucose. Their body fat will be measured with low-dose x-rays

Day 2: Participants will have a PET scan. They will lie on a table that slides in and out of a donut-shaped scanner. They will be injected with a small amount of a radioactive substance and wear a cap on their head.

Day 3: Participants will have an MRI. They will lie on a table that slides in and out of a scanner.

Day 4: Participants will have another PET scan. This time, they will drink a milk shake during a break from the scanner. Then, they will go back inside the scanner for the end of their scan.

Day 5: Participants will wear a hood for up to 40 minutes to measure their breathing. They will also drink special water and collect samples of their urine to measure the rate they burn energy.

For 12 months after the visit, participants will track their weight and physical activity daily using a special scale and activity monitor. A few times over the year, the study team will send participants special activity monitors to use for 7 days at a time.

Participants will have an in-person 1-day follow-up visit.

NCT04280783,Active You: A Novel Exercise Program for African Americans,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04280783,,COMPLETED,"Barriers to physical activity (PA) among African Americans (AAs) have been extensively studied, yet there is a paucity of innovative PA interventions designed to address them. In recent years, many studies have used the internet to promote PA in many settings, including the home environment, but only a few studies have recruited AAs. Without innovative and culturally relevant interventions, AAs will continue reporting extremely low levels of PA and disparate cardiovascular health outcomes. In prior work, the investigators sought the input of AA focus groups to inform the development of a technology-based Physical Activity for The Heart (PATH) intervention that leverages openly accessible platforms, such as YouTube, to promote PA in any setting. The investigators designed PATH as a culturally salient action-oriented intervention that can be accessed in any setting to promote PA among inactive AAs. In this application, the investigators propose to examine whether PATH is a feasible strategy for promoting PA among inactive AAs. In Aim 1 the investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial that will include 30 inactive AAs to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the PATH intervention. In Aim 2 the investigators will examine the trend in PA and cardiovascular disease risk change from baseline to post-intervention. This approach is innovative because it leverages openly accessible technologies to provide a wide variety of free, enjoyable and action-oriented workout videos that match AAs preferences. This contribution will be significant because PATH could offer a novel, low-cost, and scalable strategy for promoting PA among individuals facing socio-environmental barriers to PA.",YES,Cardiovascular Risk Factor|Prediabetes|Overweight and Obesity|Sedentary Behavior,BEHAVIORAL: The Physical Activity for The Heart (PATH) intervention|BEHAVIORAL: Be Active Your Way Booklet,"Percentage of Participants Retained at the End of Study, Will be indicated by the number of enrolled participants who are retained by the end of the study., Post-intervention at 12 weeks|Percentage of Participants Who Self-monitored Step Count Using Wrist Worn ActiGraph GT9X Over the Study Period, will be indicated by the proportion of the sample with ≥4days per week of valid Actigraph wear time (≥10hrs) during the entire course of the study., Post-intervention at 12 weeks|Acceptability of PATH Intervention, Percentage of participants who reported the PATH platform was culturally appropriate, Post-intervention at 12 weeks","Body Mass Index (BMI) at 12 Weeks, BMI will be measured using Fitbit Aria II scale provided to the participant by the study team.

NCT03146156,Lifestyle Intervention in Preparation for Pregnancy (LIPP),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03146156,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Studies evaluating lifestyle intervention in obese women during pregnancy have reported limited success in decreasing excessive gestational weight gain, and have failed to achieve the key outcome of breaking the obesity cycle and reducing neonatal adiposity or birth weight. Although some investigators advocate weight loss during pregnancy in obese women, these recommendations were based on extrapolation of retrospective epidemiological data. Of concern, we reported increased small for gestational age babies and decreased lean body mass in neonates of obese women with weight loss or inadequate gestational weight gain. Based on our research, optimal outcomes from lifestyle interventions are likely to be temporal and therefore must be initiated prior to conception to first improve maternal metabolic function, and subsequently, placental/fetal growth. Several large retrospective cohort studies support our hypothesis. For example, women who lost weight between pregnancies had fewer large for gestational age babies in contrast to women who increased interpregnancy weight. In addition, prospective randomized controlled trials have shown that postpartum weight loss is achievable without adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes, these studies include women who breastfed. Based on these observations, we propose a randomized control trial to determine the effect of lifestyle intervention initiated prior to a planned pregnancy on improving neonatal metabolism and adiposity. Our overarching hypothesis is that the maternal pre-pregnancy metabolic condition determines the obesogenic in-utero environment, which affects programming of placental mitochondrial function and metabolic pathways, promoting lipid accumulation and neonatal adiposity. Our rationale is based on the need to establish the most effective time to introduce an intervention that will break the obesity cycle in mothers and their children. Understanding how pregravid metabolic conditioning improves maternal physiology, and cellular and molecular function in pregnancy will provide the empirical data to support the intervention. We have a highly successful record of recruiting women who are planning a pregnancy, obtaining compliance in longitudinal studies, and in long-term follow-up of mothers and their offspring. Lifestyle intervention will be initiated prior to conception to decrease maternal body fat, inflammation, insulin resistance, and ?-cell dysfunction. Our transdisciplinary team has the required expertise in lifestyle interventions management of obesity, and in human physiology that is needed to determine the effects of these interventions on maternal metabolism and fetalplacental growth and function. We will recruit 200 women to pursue the following specific aims:

Specific Aim 1: To investigate the physiological significance of lifestyle intervention in preparation for pregnancy (LIPP) on maternal and neonatal metabolism and adiposity.

NCT04651218,Behavioral Mechanism of Energy Compensation With Exercise,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04651218,,COMPLETED,"Over 70% of Americans are either overweight or obese, putting them at risk for many chronic diseases including diabetes. Exercise is commonly used as a weight loss and weight loss maintenance strategy. However, exercise-induced weight loss is often much less than expected as individuals compensate for a large portion of the energy expended through exercise, resisting maintenance of the negative energy balance needed for weight loss. Our prior research, in agreement with others, point to increases in energy intake as the primary compensatory response when exercising for weight loss; however, mechanisms promoting this behavior have yet to be fully elucidated. With obesity and diabetes prevalence continually rising, innovative research is needed to identify novel mechanisms promoting energy compensation with exercise. The long-term goal of this proposal is to reduce the incidence and improve the outcomes of obesity-related diseases by developing interventions that will attenuate compensation for the energy expended through exercise and thus improve initial weight loss and weight loss maintenance. The present proposal will take the necessary first steps towards our long-term goal by identifying novel mechanisms promoting energy intake when exercising for weight loss.

One's reinforcing value of food, attentional bias and inhibitory control for food cues play an important role in feeding behaviors, independent of hunger. These behaviors are largely a product of the central dopamine reward system, which is also in play with exercise behavior. This provides mechanistic support for our central hypothesis, that exercise evokes increases in food reinforcement, attentional bias, and lowers inhibitory control for food cues to promote greater energy intake in effort to maintain energy homeostasis. The rationale for this project is by elucidating the mechanisms mediating energy compensation, future interventions can be designed that attenuate this response to improve the utility of exercise as a weight loss intervention to prevent and manage T2DM. The overall objective of the current proposal is to demonstrate an acute bout of exercise alters food reinforcement, attentional bias and inhibitory control for food cues. Upon completion, we will have a greater understanding of the mechanisms underpinning compensatory increases in energy intake when exercising. These findings will pave the way for future clinical trials testing this hypothesis in the context of a long-term exercise intervention. This contribution is significant, as the identification of novel mechanisms influencing energy compensation with exercise is needed to provide strong support for the development of novel, evidence-based interventions to attenuate this compensatory response to exercise, improving its efficacy for weight control and chronic disease management.",YES,Obesity|Weight Loss|Eating Behavior,BEHAVIORAL: exericse,"Attentional Bias, The visual probe procedure involves eye-tracking technology that records the amount of time (ms) participants spend fixated on images projected on a computer screen \[80-82\].

NCT03505658,Abriendo Caminos 2: Clearing the Path to Hispanic Health,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03505658,,UNKNOWN,"Obesity is significantly higher in specific ethnic groups and, in particular, Hispanics. There is an urgent need to implement culturally-sensitive lifestyle interventions and educational programs to decrease the burden of obesity and obesity-related metabolic diseases in Hispanic populations. Accordingly, our overreaching goal is to tailor an existing and successful community-based program, Abriendo Caminos, to leverage effectiveness in promoting healthy nutrition and life-style behaviors among low income, low literacy Hispanic-heritage families. Our multi-function integrated project proposes to (a) adapt Abriendo Caminos for 6-18 year-old children from Mexican and Puerto Rican heritage in five different locations (California, Illinois, Iowa, Puerto Rico, and Texas) and (b) Train existing professionals (in Extension and community agencies) and future professionals (Hispanic university students) to meet the specific needs of this population. Our central hypothesis is that participation in a 6-week community-based program will prevent childhood obesity/maintain healthy weight by significantly increasing: (a) healthy dietary behavior patterns and basic knowledge of nutrition; (b) physical activity levels; and (c) the organization of collective/shared family mealtimes. The implementation of this culturally sensitive, workshop-based curriculum in different regions across the country will help to train the next generation of professionals in Extension and communities to deliver programs that meet the needs of Hispanic families.

One method researchers will use is the traditional method of reaching out to potential participants. The traditional method includes using flyers, posters, and booklets. The other method will be to target people who might be especially interested in the study. The second method uses medical records to find potential participants who are most likely to qualify for the study. This study is also being done to what works to help keep participants in a study like this.

Another goal of the study is to find out what methods work well to help get and keep children's and caregiver's weight in the healthy range. Researchers also want to see what works well to help children with a high Body Mass Index be more physically active and to eat healthier foods. The test methods researchers will use for this part of the study are (1) newsletters only and (2) newsletters plus online meetings. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 groups (newsletter or newsletter plus meetings.)

The newsletter-only group will receive monthly newsletters about children's health; this group will receive these letters for 6 months.

Visual analog scales (VAS) are presented on an iPad screen. The scale assesses response to taste after the participant consumes a small amount of the beverage. Perceived pleasantness of, and desire to consume the two beverages is measured using adapted labeled hedonic scales at pre-/post-intervention. Pleasantness is phrased 'How pleasant is this taste' and anchored by (-100) 'most unpleasant imaginable' to (100) 'most pleasant imaginable', and 'neutral' (0) in the middle. Desire follows a similar pattern using 'desire to consume' as the phrasing. Pleasantness and desire of the assigned beverage is also evaluated at the 9 intervention assessments.

Reactions containing 20ng of DNA are performed in 10 µl reactions with TaqMan Universal Polymerase Chain Reaction Master Mix using standard cycling conditions. Independent investigators score allele sizes; inconsistencies are reviewed and rerun when necessary. For every assay, each 96-well plate includes non-template and DNA standards of known genotype. All genotyping is performed at the UNC-CH Advanced Analytics Core, Baseline Assessment; Post-Intervention Assessment, Post-Intervention Assessment completed approximately 5 weeks after the Baseline Assessment|Change in Food Pattern From Baseline to Post-Intervention Assessment by Food Frequency Questionnaire, The Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) is a self-reported checklist of 76 foods and beverages with a frequency response section. Subjects report generally how often each item is consumed over a two-week period of time. The six possible responses are 1= never in the last two weeks, 2= 1-3 times in the last 2 weeks, 3= 4-6 times in the last 2 weeks, 4= 7-9 times in the last two weeks, 5= 10-13 times in the last 2 weeks, 6= daily or more in the last two weeks. Response information is used to estimate daily caloric intake (number of kcal) and macronutrient content (percent calories from carbohydrate/fat/protein). Food pattern is assessed as an aggregate of these measures. Changes in food pattern will be assessed as a difference from baseline to post-intervention assessment., Baseline Assessment; Post-Intervention Assessment, Post-Intervention Assessment completed approximately 5 weeks after the Baseline Assessment|Change in Beverage Intake Pattern From Baseline to Post-Intervention Assessment by Beverage Intake Questionnaire, To better capture variation in regular beverage intake patterns, the Beverage Intake Questionnaire is administered which queries directly about intake of all types of beverages.

Changes in physical activity are assessed as a difference from pre- to post-intervention assessment., Baseline Assessment; Post-Intervention Assessment, Post-Intervention Assessment completed approximately 5 weeks after the Baseline Assessment|Change in Restrained Eating Subscale Score as Measured on Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire, The Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire is a 33-item self-report measure designed to assess the type of eating behavior and is organized into 3 subscales (emotional eating, externally-induced eating, and restrained eating). Subjects rate the frequency of their eating behaviors using a 5-point scale, where 1=never, 2=seldom, 3=sometimes, 4=often, and 5=very often. The Restrained Eating subscale consisted of 10 items and the scores range from 10 (worse outcome) to 50 (better outcome). The change is calculated as the difference between scores at Baseline and Post-Intervention Assessment., Baseline Assessment; Post-Intervention Assessment, Post-Intervention Assessment completed approximately 5 weeks after the Baseline Assessment|Change in Food Craving as Assessed by the Food Craving Inventory (FCI) Score Changes of Food Pattern From Baseline by Food Frequency Questionnaire During the Intervention, The Food Craving Inventory is a 28-item instrument measuring the frequency over the past month of general cravings and cravings for specific types of foods, namely: high fats, sweets, carbohydrates/starches, and fast-food fats. Subjects rate how often they have experienced a craving for each food on a 5-point frequency scale, where 1=never, 2=rarely (once or twice), 3=sometimes, 4= often, 5= always/almost every day. Food craving score is calculated as a total sum, and the change score is calculated from the difference between baseline to post-intervention assessment., Baseline Assessment; Post-Intervention Assessment, Post-Intervention Assessment completed approximately 5 weeks after the Baseline Assessment|Change in Hedonic Hunger as Assessed by the Power of Food Scale (PFS) Score, The Power of Food scale assesses reported appetitive drive, food reward responsivity, sensitivity to food cues in the environment, and the frequency of food-related thoughts. The 21-item scale prompts subjects to rate how much they agree with statements about hedonic hunger on a 5-point scale, where 1=do not agree at all, 2=agree a little, 3=agree somewhat, 4=agree, and 5=strongly agree. The change in total PFS score will be calculated from the difference between baseline to post-intervention assessment., Baseline Assessment; Post-Intervention Assessment, Post-Intervention Assessment completed approximately 5 weeks after the Baseline Assessment|Change in Food Habits as Assessed by the Yale Food Addiction Scale, The Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) is designed to identify participants who exhibit signs of possible food addiction to specific foods. The 9-item questionnaire is based on substance dependence criteria in the DSM-IV-TR, as well as on scales that are used to assess behavioral addictions. Subjects rate how often they have experienced a possible food addictive behavior on a 5-point frequency scale, where 0=never, 1=once a month, 2=2-4 times per month, 3= 2-3 times per week, 4= 4+ times per week.

Executive control scores will be calculated as a joint function of response accuracy and speed. Metric: accuracy (number of errors on mismatched trials) and reaction time (average reaction time in seconds on mismatched trials). A higher number of errors on mismatched trails and longer reaction times on mismatched trials indicate worse executive control., 15 minutes after delivery of the intervention|Delay discounting, Delay discounting involves the subjective depreciation of an incentive based on its timing. The measure assesses the ability to delay gratification, that is, a tendency to prioritize larger long-term rewards over smaller short-term rewards. The task involves choosing short vs. long-term rewards from a set of five dichotomous choices (e.g., to receive $1 immediately or $10 in one month). The task takes about 1 minute to administer, is highly reliable, and correlates well with longer and more extensive measures of delay discounting (metric: discount rate (k) ranges from 0-1). Scores will range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating more impulsivity/lower ability to delay gratification., 20 minutes after delivery of the intervention|Change in cortisol from baseline to first follow-up assessment, The investigators will measure cortisol secretion via saliva (passive drool) 25 minutes after delivery of the intervention (first follow-up) and compare it to baseline cortisol levels., 25 minutes after delivery of the intervention|Comfort eating, Comfort eating will be assessed via an eating task to objectively measure hyper-palatable (high-fat, -sodium, -sugar, and -carbohydrate) food intake. To avoid floor effects, the eating task will take place under the guise of a faux taste test, which will ostensibly guide the development of the food marketing campaign later during the study. To avoid ceiling effects and to allow eating behavior without fear that the experimenter will negatively judge the amount eaten, large quantities of each food will be made available. The task will take 10 minutes to complete and will be conducted in a private room. Bowls will be weighed (unobtrusively) before and after the task to compute the difference in grams, which will then be converted to kilocalories based on published nutrition information from the food maker. Higher kilocalorie consumption indicates a tendency to engage in more comfort eating during times of stress., 30 minutes after delivery of the intervention|Social withdrawal, Social withdrawal will be assessed with a measure from previous research. The experimenter will present three options for working on the final task: alone, with a former group member, or with a new partner. Choosing to work alone reflects a desire to avoid social interaction. Each response will be assigned a numerical code (work alone = 0; work with a former group member = 1; work with a new partner = 2). Scores of zero indicate a greater tendency to withdraw socially during times of stress., 45 minutes after delivery of the intervention|Change in cortisol from baseline to second follow-up assessment, The investigators will measure cortisol secretion via saliva (passive drool) 60 minutes after delivery of the intervention (second follow-up) and compare it to baseline cortisol levels., 60 minutes after delivery of the intervention",,,Florida State University,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)",ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,320,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (PARTICIPANT)|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,R56HL159177|R56HL159177,01-02-2023,2024-05,2024-05,06-02-2023,,13-10-2023,"Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida, 32306, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/96/NCT05714696/Prot_SAP_000.pdf|Informed Consent Form, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/96/NCT05714696/ICF_001.pdf"

The main aims are to:

* Examine the usability of a dDSM log that uses positive reinforcement (praise and gamification) among children 8-12 years with overweight or obesity and their adult caregivers.
* Examine the acceptability of a dDSM log that uses positive reinforcement (praise and gamification) among children 8-12 years with overweight or obesity and their adult caregivers
* Conduct a proof-of-concept trial that examines the effects of positive reinforcement on child DSM behaviors.
* Explore differences in children's intrinsic motivation.

Participating children will be instructed to self-monitor their daily intake of targeted food groups (fruits, vegetables, sweet and salty snack foods, and sugar-sweetened beverages) for 4 weeks using a personal web-based DSM log. Each child-caregiver dyad will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions: BASIC, PRAISE, GAME, or PRAISE+GAME. For PRAISE and PRAISE+GAME conditions, caregivers will be instructed to provide daily process praise to their child related to DSM behaviors.

NCT02425046,Family Obesity Intervention: Motivational Interviewing and Community Support,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02425046,,COMPLETED,"Low-income children and children of obese parents are at high risk of obesity. Effective interventions are needed to target these families to improve the health of the parents and prevent obesity in the children. The hypothesis is that an intervention that combines engagement of community organizations, motivational interviewing (MI, a technique proven to help people set goals that are personally meaningful), and resource mobilization will change diet and physical activity habits among disadvantaged families. This proposal grew from an established community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership between the research team and community organizations that serve high minority (45-55%), low-income populations. Partners include a community health center, a food pantry network, a work-force training program, and other agencies. These partners designed and implemented a successful pilot project on which this proposal is based. The specific aims of this proposal are 1) To evaluate the efficacy of a family-targeted obesity intervention based on MI and resource-mobilization. Hypotheses: In comparison to control families, families participating in the intervention will demonstrate a) a reduction in BMI for adults, b) an increase in minutes of moderate physical activity and decreased sedentary time for both adults and children accelerometer), and c) a reduction in the number of obesity risk behaviors and an increase in obesity prevention behaviors among children. 2) To examine the mediators of intervention effects. 3) Identify the types of resources needed most often by intervention families to support lifestyle change. This randomized controlled trial includes 260 low-income families that contain at least one obese adult and one normal or overweight child between 6 and 12. The 12-month intervention has two elements. 1) A health coach will use MI to help families explore ambivalence toward and motivations for change and set goals for improving diet and physical activity. 2) To support goals, families will be connected with community agencies that can assist with general (e.g., financial) and goal specific resources (e.g., food, physical activity opportunities). Collaboration between organizations will streamline referrals, maximize resources, and facilitate access. Control families will get a basic screen for needs and information about available community resources. Outcomes are measured at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. This intervention is innovative in that it 1) focuses on lifestyle changes for the entire family and measures outcomes in adults and children, 2) combines MI focused on the entire family and community resource referrals specific to family needs and goals for change, 3) partners community organizations to coordinate resources for families, and 4) involves partners in all research phases via a CBPR approach. This contribution will be significant because the proposed intervention, if successful, can be replicated elsewhere and adapted to the local resource environment to address adult obesity and prevent childhood obesity in a high-risk population.

Energy expenditure based on time spent in sleep and physical activities can be estimated. Sub-scores of energy expenditure for each of the following activities are calculated, summed, and averaged to estimate energy expenditure as kilocalories per day: sleep, moderate physical activity, hard physical activity, and very hard physical activity. Higher scores indicate greater physical activity per day. Metabolic equivalent (MET) value for each activity is provided: 1 MET for sleep, 4 METs for moderate activity, 6 METs for hard activity, and 10 METs for very hard activity.

The score range is 0 - 100 for each subscale. Higher scores on the Support and Stress scales indicate higher levels of perceived social support and stress, respectively. For each subscale, responses are summed up as raw scores. The raw scores are divided by the appropriate factors and multiplied by 100, resulting in a scaled score between 0 and 100. Calculation for Social Support involves summing up items related to Family Support and Non-Family Support and hence provides a composite score for the two sources of social support. Similarly, calculation for Social Stress involves summing up items related to Family Stress and Non-Family Stress., baseline to 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 12 months - 18/24 months|Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), The PSS measures how different situations can affect emotions and perceived stress.
