NCT03149328,Electronic Patient-Reported Outcomes in Clinical Kidney Practice (ePRO Kidney),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03149328,,COMPLETED,"People living with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) need dialysis or transplantation in order to stay alive. This illness and treatment significantly impact peoples' health, emotions, work and relationships. To promote person-centred care, healthcare professionals should be asking patients about what matters to them and using this feedback to plan and deliver care. Patient-reported outcome and experience questionnaires (jointly referred to as PROs) allow patients to provide information about their quality of life, symptoms and experiences with care. PROs are increasingly used to help healthcare professionals learn about what is important to patients and the impacts of illness or treatments from patients' point of view. Embedding feedback from patients into routine clinical practice is important in end-stage kidney disease because of the physical and quality of life challenges these patients face when living with kidney failure.

PROs provide vital and often missing information that the healthcare team can use to support patients. However, PROs administered via paper questionnaires have been perceived as cumbersome, difficult to integrate with other health information and do not provide immediate feedback.

In this research, home dialysis patients will have the opportunity to complete electronically administered PROs (ePROs) and healthcare professionals will receive education about how to use PRO information. The goal is to learn how to support healthcare professionals to routinely use this information to inform patient care, and see if this makes a difference in patients' symptoms, person-centred care, quality of life and satisfaction with care.

Learning what matters most to patients is essential for healthcare professionals to provide person-centred care. This research will address the gap in our understanding of how to best use patients' reports in healthcare. Findings of this research may ultimately improve the quality of healthcare for Canadians living with end-stage kidney disease.",YES,"Kidney Disease, End-Stage",OTHER: Educational Support,"Symptoms - Trajectory of Change, Assessed using the symptoms/problems domain of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life 36-Item Short Form Survey (KDQOL-36).

The PACIC-20 is a 20-item survey based on five subscales: (1) patient activation, (2) delivery system design and decision support, (3) goal setting and tailoring, (4) problem-solving and contextual counselling, and (5) follow-up and coordination. Each item is rated on a five-point scale (from ""Almost never = 0"" to ""Almost always = 5"") and the subscale and total scores are based on average scores across items. Min score = 0; Max score = 5.

The SF-12 uses 2 items (psychological distress and psychological well being) to measure the MCS score. The summary score is transformed using Canadian norm-based scoring. The scores ranged from 0 (worst health) to 100 (best health). The higher the score the better the mental health., Trajectories of up to 24 months from start of enrollment to study completion|Quality of Life - Trajectory of Change, Assessed using the Euro Quality of Life EQ-5D-5L. This assessment uses a descriptive system for health-related Quality of Life states in adults consisting of 5 dimensions; Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort, and Anxiety/Depression. Each dimension is scored between 1 = indicating no problem and 5 = indicating unable to/extreme problems. An EQ-5D summary index is derived by applying a formula (the Canadian standard value set) that attaches values (weights) to each of the levels in each dimension. Index min= 0.0 max = 1.0.

NCT03197038,Exercise Training and Cognitive Function in Kidney Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03197038,,COMPLETED,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD), affects over 45% of all individuals over 70 years of age. Patients with moderate CKD have more than a two-fold increased risk of cognitive impairment than those without CKD; furthermore, as many as 20-70% of patients with CKD have established cognitive impairment and overt dementia. The burden of cognitive impairment and dementia leads to functional decline and accelerated loss of independence, contributing to the tremendous individual, societal, and economic burden of CKD (i.e., 20% of Medicare expenditures in adults \>65 years of age). There is no recommended treatment to prevent cognitive decline in CKD patients, and the few medications available for cognitive impairment have only short term modest effects. There is a critical need to evaluate therapies to forestall cognitive impairment, and maintain or improve cognitive functioning in older patients with CKD. To address this need, this study will test the hypothesis that older patients with moderate/severe CKD and pre-clinical cognitive impairment randomized to a 6-month home-based exercise program will improve cognitive function and MRI measured brain structure, compared to a usual care control group.
