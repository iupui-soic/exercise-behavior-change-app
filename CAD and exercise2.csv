Heart failure (HF), a clinical syndrome that develops as a consequence of heart disease, is characterized by the worsening of symptoms, such as dyspnea and fatigue, upon exertion, collectively defined as ""exercise intolerance"". Surprisingly, exercise intolerance does not correlate with the degree of cardiac contractile (ventricular) dysfunction, suggesting that changes in the peripheral circulation may be to blame for exercise intolerance in this cohort. Though there are a host of factors that may contribute to this impairment, disease-related increases in circulating endothelin-1 (ET-1) may be a significant factor in the sequelae of exercise intolerance in HF.

NCT04280783,Active You: A Novel Exercise Program for African Americans,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04280783,,COMPLETED,"Barriers to physical activity (PA) among African Americans (AAs) have been extensively studied, yet there is a paucity of innovative PA interventions designed to address them. In recent years, many studies have used the internet to promote PA in many settings, including the home environment, but only a few studies have recruited AAs. Without innovative and culturally relevant interventions, AAs will continue reporting extremely low levels of PA and disparate cardiovascular health outcomes. In prior work, the investigators sought the input of AA focus groups to inform the development of a technology-based Physical Activity for The Heart (PATH) intervention that leverages openly accessible platforms, such as YouTube, to promote PA in any setting. The investigators designed PATH as a culturally salient action-oriented intervention that can be accessed in any setting to promote PA among inactive AAs. In this application, the investigators propose to examine whether PATH is a feasible strategy for promoting PA among inactive AAs. In Aim 1 the investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial that will include 30 inactive AAs to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the PATH intervention. In Aim 2 the investigators will examine the trend in PA and cardiovascular disease risk change from baseline to post-intervention. This approach is innovative because it leverages openly accessible technologies to provide a wide variety of free, enjoyable and action-oriented workout videos that match AAs preferences.

NCT03565874,Heart Rate Variability and Prematurity,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03565874,,COMPLETED,"Mothers who deliver prematurely (\<37 weeks of gestational age) experience intense stress and anxiety given that their child's survival and development might be compromised. From the existing literature, it is known that a heart rate variability biofeedback (HRVB) program increases heart rate variability (HRV), which in turn, is related to significant reductions in perceived stress and anxiety. This study's aim is to evaluate the feasibility of an HRVB program in a sample of mothers who delivered prematurely.",YES,Premature Birth|Maternal Distress - Delivered|Stress|Anxiety,DEVICE: Heart rate variability biofeedback,"Feasibility: Acceptance (Ratio), The ratio of acceptance of study participation (number of participants who accept to participate to the study / number of participants to whom the study has been proposed) \* 100, After completing the HRVB program (on average 3 weeks)|Feasibility: Drop-out, The ratio of drop out., After completing the HRVB program (on average 3 weeks)|Feasibility: Number of Sessions Completed During Study, Compliance with study protocol regarding the number of sessions attended by the participants., After completing the HRVB program (on average 3 weeks)|Satisfaction Regarding the Intervention, Satisfaction will be measured through a questionnaire. Questions will be asked about global satisfaction, utility, timing and difficulty about their experience (assessed on single item Likert scale).

Higher scores reflects more satisfaction. Possible range 2 to 10., After completing the HRVB program (on average 3 weeks)","HRV: RMSDD, The root-mean square differences of successive R-R intervals (RMSDD) will be used as measures to assess HRV level before and after participation in the HRVB program., Before and after completing the HRVB program (on average 3 weeks).|HRV: HF, High Frequency (HF) will be used as measures to assess HRV level before and after participation in the HRVB program., Before and after completing the HRVB program (on average 3 weeks).|Stress, Perceived stress will be measured on the Perceived Stress Scale-14 (PSS-14). PSS-14 score is calculated on 14 items ranging from 0 to 4. The 7 positive state items (4,5,6,7,9,10 and 13) must have their score reversed (0=4, 1=3, 2=2, 3=1, 4=0) in order to calculate the total score by summing up all 14 items.(Min=0, Max=56). Higher scores indicate a higher level of stress. A validated French version of the PSS will be used., Before and after completing the HRVB program (on average 3 weeks).|PTSD, Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms will be measured with the Post-traumatic stress disorder checklist (PCL-5) for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition (DSM-5). PCL-5 is a 20 items self-report measure that assesses the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. Items on the PCL-5 correspond to DSM-5 criteria for PTSD. Each item is rated on a 5 point Likert scale (from ""Not at all"" to ""Extremely""). Total score is calculated by adding up scores for all items (Min = 0, Max = 80). Higher scores indicate a higher level of PTSD. A validated French version of the PCL will be used., Before and after completing the HRVB program (on average 3 weeks).|Anxiety, Anxiety symptoms will be measured with the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). STAI score is calculated on 40 items (20 items assessing trait anxiety and 20 items assessing state anxiety) rated on a 4 point Likert scale (from ""Almost never"" to ""Almost always""). Total score for state and trait anxiety is calculated by adding up all items (Min = 20, Max = 80).

Higher scores indicate a higher level of anxiety. A validated French version of the STAI will be used., Before and after completing the HRVB program (on average 3 weeks).|Depression, Depression symptoms will be assessed with a 13-item short form of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), which is a 13-item, self-report rating inventory that measures symptoms of depression. The scale for each item goes from 0 to 3.

Total score is calculated by adding up scores from each item (Min = 0, Max = 39).

Higher scores indicate a higher level of depression. A validated French version of the BDI will be used., Before and after completing the HRVB program (on average 3 weeks).",,University of Lausanne Hospitals,,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,6,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: DEVICE_FEASIBILITY,2017-02199,2018-06-12,2019-03-08,2019-03-08,2018-06-21,2019-05-10,2019-10-15,"Centre Hospitaliter Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne, Vaud, 1004, Switzerland","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/74/NCT03565874/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"
