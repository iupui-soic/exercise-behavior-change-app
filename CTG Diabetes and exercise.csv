NCT01977417,Inflammation Inhibition in Prediabetic Humans,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01977417,INCITE,TERMINATED,"Prediabetes, characterized by elevated fasting blood sugar or exaggerated blood sugar response to sugar ingestion, effects over 79 million adult Americans and is a precursor to the development of Type 2 diabetes. Importantly, approximately 42% of Iowans (950,000) have diabetes and 32% (670,000) have prediabetes with the majority of those with prediabetes going undiagnosed. Adults with prediabetes demonstrate early signs of cardiovascular and nervous system abnormalities and are at high risk for developing overt diabetes unless aggressive lifestyle (weight loss, exercise) or pharmacological interventions are employed. Interestingly, data in recent years has linked obesity and diabetes to chronic inflammation of the blood vessels and brain areas that regulate blood pressure. Therefore, the current study will test whether a commonly used aspirin-like anti-inflammatory drug called salsalate, will improve blood vessel health and nervous system dysfunction in adults with prediabetes. Eligible subjects will have measurements of blood pressure, blood vessel function in the arms and eyes, assessments of nerve activity, and blood samples taken before and after 4 weeks of ingesting an FDA approved aspirin-like drug called salsalate. The study is important because it will identify a potentially new pharmacological strategy to treat vascular and nervous system abnormalities in overweight and obese adults with early stage type 2 diabetes using an inexpensive, generically available drug with an excellent safety record that has been used for decades to treat chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. If proven effective, this will provide preliminary support for the concept of targeting inflammation as a new clinical approach to treating early diabetes related complications. Furthermore, the current pilot study will provide support for developing a larger clinical trial using salsalate that could potentially then be extended to patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, as well as lead to the development of new anti-inflammatory agents with greater specificity for selective inflammatory pathways.",YES,Prediabetes|Obese,DRUG: Salsalate|DRUG: Placebo,"Aim 1: Vascular Endothelial Function in Obese Prediabetic Adults Before and After 1 Month of Salsalate or Placebo., Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, Change from baseline at 4 weeks",,,Gary L.

First, the investigators examined the associations between mindfulness and diabetes-related outcomes. It was hypothesized that at baseline, increased mindfulness would be associated with decreased diabetes distress and more optimal glycemic levels and that all three variables would share similar associations with related constructs including greater self-compassion, lower general stress, better psychosocial health, increased diabetes treatment engagement, and greater diabetes-related quality of life. The association between specific aspects of dispositional mindfulness and diabetes distress was also explored. Second, the investigators examined the acceptability, feasibility, and potential utility of self-led MBSR intervention. It was hypothesized that participation in a self-led MBSR intervention would be feasible and acceptable, evidenced by treatment attrition and participant feedback.

NCT04621045,Active You: Feasibility of a Unique Physical Activity Program to Prevent Diabetes and Heart Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04621045,,COMPLETED,"Individuals who are overweight/obese are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes (T2D). Current evidence suggests that PA, even without dietary prescription, can be efficacious in preventing T2D. Yet most Americans, especially those who are overweight/obese, are not physically active. Socioenvironmental barriers to physical activity (PA) such as body image concerns and limited access to fitness facilities contribute to the low levels of PA observed in overweight/obese adults. Web-based PA programs have been developed to address these barriers, but the outcomes have been marginal. Qualitative studies suggest that individuals who are overweight/obese prefer PA programs that feature people they can relate to especially in body size, fitness status and age. Previously, the investigators have included these preferences in a technology-based Physical Activity for The Heart (PATH) intervention that leverages open source platforms, such as YouTube, to promote PA in any setting. In this application, the investigators propose to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of PATH in promoting PA and reducing cardiometabolic risk in adults who are overweight/obese and at high risk of diabetes. In Aim 1 the investigators will conduct a 12-week randomized clinical trial including 52 adults who are overweight/obese and at high risk of diabetes to assess the feasibility and acceptability of PATH.

TITLE Post-delivery intervention in women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus for weight loss, glycaemia and cardiovascular health DESIGN Feasibility study Allocation: RCT AIMS To determine the feasibility of a post-delivery intervention to improve glycemia and cardiovascular function and promote weight loss in women who have had gestational diabetes.

OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome; Effect of intervention on HbA1c: difference in HbA1c between intervention arm and control arm measured at 12 weeks.

Secondary Outcomes;

* Adherence to intervention;
* Willingness to be randomised to post-delivery intervention;
* Process measures to evaluate patient experience of study and intervention;
* Participants' preferred time to commence the study, within the start date allowance of 6 weeks - 6 month post-delivery.
* Between-arm differences and within-arm differences to evaluate:

  * Effect of intervention on HbA1c at 12 and 24 weeks
  * Effect of intervention on weight and BMI at 12 and 24 weeks
  * Effect of intervention on systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 12 and 24 weeks
  * Effect of intervention on lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL) at 12 and 24 weeks
  * Effect of intervention on physical activity at 12 and 24 weeks POPULATION We will recruit 50 women aged 18-45 with previous gestational diabetes and randomise them to 1 of 2 arms to commence study at 6 weeks - 6 months post-delivery. Women starting the study at 13 weeks post-delivery will have their routine post-delivery HbA1c act as baseline HBA1c.

ELIGIBILITY Pregnant women with gestational diabetes (women will be given the option to start the study between 6 weeks and 6 months post-delivery) or women who have given birth in the last 12 months and had gestational diabetes during that pregnancy; aged 18-45; and access to a smartphone with an operating system of iOS 9.0 or above, or Android 5.0 or above.

NCT03689530,Using Peer Support to Aid in Prevention and Treatment in Prediabetes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03689530,UPSTART,COMPLETED,"An estimated 86 million adults in the United States have prediabetes, and low-income Latino and African American adults have disproportionately high rates compared to non-Hispanic adults. Structured lifestyle interventions can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in these at-risk populations and now are widely offered at community organizations and health systems. Yet, uptake of and engagement in available formal programs is very low. Low-income adults in particular face multiple barriers to navigating, engaging in, and sustaining involvement in available programs and lifestyle behaviors found to decrease progression to diabetes. It is critically important to develop and evaluate innovative approaches to increase uptake, engagement, and maintenance of gains in diabetes prevention activities. Peer support has been shown in the investigators' and others' effectiveness trials to be a sustainable, effective approach for positive behavior change and improved outcomes in adults with diabetes and other chronic conditions. The study team's pilot work suggests such approaches are feasible and acceptable among low-income Latino and African American patients with prediabetes to prevent chronic disease and better navigate their health care systems to obtain healthy lifestyle counseling and support. However, such peer support models among Latino, African American, and other low-income adults with prediabetes have not yet been rigorously evaluated. Accordingly, the study will conduct a parallel, two-arm randomized controlled trial in primary care centers in two different health systems that serve multi-ethnic communities with a high concentration of Latinos and African Americans and diverse socio-economic backgrounds. The study will compare enhanced usual care (providing referrals to diabetes prevention programs and resources) with a model of a structured behavioral change intervention supplementing enhanced referral to programs and resources with peer support to help link adults with prediabetes to existing health system and community diabetes prevention programs, to support their engagement in formal programs, maintain achieved gains, and support participants to initiate and sustain healthy behaviors to prevent diabetes.",YES,PreDiabetes,BEHAVIORAL: Peer Support|BEHAVIORAL: Enhanced Usual Care,"Change in Glycosylated Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 6 Months, An A1C test measures the percentage of red blood cells that have glucose-coated hemoglobin.

Responses for each individual question range from 1 (not at all true) to 7 (very true). The responses to all 4-items are averaged (range: 1-7).

NCT01862029,Effects of Roflumilast on Insulin and Blood Sugar Levels in Prediabetic Overweight and Obese Individuals,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01862029,,COMPLETED,"Background:

- Roflumilast is a drug used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is designed to help reduce lung inflammation. However, during testing, roflumilast also appeared to reduce high blood sugar levels in people with COPD and type 2 diabetes. Other tests showed that roflumilast also improved blood sugar levels in people who only had type 2 diabetes. Researchers want to see how roflumilast affects insulin and blood sugar levels in overweight or obese people who are not diabetic, but who have high blood sugar levels.

Objectives:

- To see how well roflumilast improves blood sugar and insulin levels in prediabetic overweight or obese individuals.

Eligibility:

- Individuals between 30 to 65 years old who are overweight or obese (body mass index of 24.9 to 39.9 kg/m2) and have elevated blood sugar levels.

Design:

* This study will last approximately 8 weeks. Participants will have approximately five study visits over about 7 weeks. Two of these visits will be overnight inpatient stays.
* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected. They will also have a 3-day diet and exercise assessment with a dietitian.
* In Week 1, participants will have a special diet for 2 days to keep their regular weight. They will then have a 2-day inpatient stay. During their stay, they will have multiple tests, including blood sugar tests and full body scans. They may provide a fat and muscle tissue biopsy sample. They will then receive the study drug to take during the study.
* In Week 2, participants will repeat the diet study from the screening visit. They will receive a different dose of the study drug.
* In Week 3, participants will review their diet results and have blood and urine tests.
* In Week 5, participants will repeat the diet and exercise study from the screening visit.
* In Week 6, participants will repeat the inpatient studies and tests from Week 1.

NCT03077360,Skeletal Muscle Diacylglycerol and Sphingolipids - Impact of Localization and Species on Insulin Resistance in Humans,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03077360,,COMPLETED,"The rationale for the proposed research is that elucidating changes in localized diacylglycerol (DAG) and sphingolipid species that predict insulin sensitivity will reveal specific localized lipids to target in therapeutics for type 2 diabetes. To attain the overall objective, the investigators propose three specific aims: 1. Identify the influence of sarcolemmal DAG and sphingolipids on cell signaling and insulin sensitivity before and after insulin sensitizing lifestyle interventions. Strong preliminary data shape the hypothesis that sarcolemmal 1,2-disaturated DAG and C18:0 ceramide species will decrease after insulin sensitizing lifestyle interventions, leading to less Protein kinase C (PKC) and Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activation, and enhanced insulin signaling. Skeletal muscle DAG and sphingolipid isomers, species, localization, and de novo synthesis will be measured before and after diet-induced weight loss or exercise training interventions in obese men and women. Insulin sensitivity will be measured using insulin clamps, and muscle lipids using Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS). 2. Determine the impact of mitochondrial/ER (endoplasmic reticulum) DAG and sphingolipids on mitochondrial function and ER stress in vivo, before and after insulin sensitizing lifestyle interventions. The investigators hypothesize, again based on preliminary data, that mitochondrial/ER sphingolipids will decrease, yet DAG will increase after insulin sensitizing lifestyle interventions, and each will associate with increased insulin sensitivity. Changes in sphingolipids will relate to increased mitochondrial function, less ER stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and acyl-carnitine formation, while changes in DAG will relate to increased mitochondrial content and dynamics. 3. Identify the effect of exogenous DAG and sphingolipids on mitochondrial function in vitro, before and after insulin sensitizing lifestyle interventions. The working hypothesis is that DAG and sphingolipids will reduce mitochondrial respiration and increase ROS and acyl-carnitine content, but will be attenuated after endurance exercise training. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantive departure from the status quo by addressing cellular compartmentalization of bioactive lipids. The investigators contribution will be significant by identifying key species and locations of DAG and sphingolipids promoting insulin resistance, as well as mechanisms explaining accumulation that could be modified by insulin sensitizing therapeutic interventions.",YES,"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2|Pre-diabetes|Obesity",BEHAVIORAL: Lifestyle,"Percent Change in Insulin Sensitivity Compared to Baseline Measurement., Hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic clamp measured as glucose infusion rate in mg/kg/min., Baseline and 12 weeks|Percent Change in Localized Muscle Lipids Compared to Baseline, We measured changes in sarcolemmal, mitochondrial, nuclear and cytosolic lipids measured in pmol/ug protein after compared to before the interventions, Baseline and 12 weeks|Percent Change in Body Weight Compared to Baseline Measurement, This is the percent change in body weight for each group after the 12 week intervention., Baseline, 3 Months",,,"University of Colorado, Denver",National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK),ALL,ADULT,NA,62,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,16-1404|5R01DK111559,2017-02-01,2020-11-19,2020-11-19,2017-03-10,2022-01-06,2022-06-21,"University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/60/NCT03077360/Prot_SAP_000.pdf|Informed Consent Form, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/60/NCT03077360/ICF_001.pdf"

Peanuts have been shown to have a similar beneficial effect on glycemic control while being more financially accessible than almonds. Glycemic control could be improved based on the low glycemic index, high fiber, lipid, and or protein content of peanuts. The acute trial (phase 1) will investigate the impact of preprandial peanut consumption on glycemic response.

Under Thailand's strong primary health system, medical management of diabetes is widely available. However, control of blood glucose and other cardiovascular disease risk factors, and regular screening for early detection of complications remain low due to a lack of services for education and counselling to support behavioural changes necessary for good self-management of the condition. A substantial literature documents the effectiveness of Diabetes Self-Management Education (DSME) programs for improving diabetes outcomes, although little high-quality data are available in Thailand, and traditional delivery models (health-professional led one-to-one or small-group sessions) are unlikely to be scalable in Thailand given current human resource and budgetary constraints. Thus, a low-cost DSME program will be developed with a scalable delivery model for roll-out within the Thai primary care system. The intervention will be based on behaviour-change and social support theories, delivered in monthly group meetings by lay health workers or nurses, and aided by a suite of short films to introduce key topics and stimulate discussion. 21 primary care units will be randomised to offer to those with diabetes diagnosed within the first three years. DSME will be delivered by lay health workers, nurses (for comparative effectiveness), or usual care.

NCT03146156,Lifestyle Intervention in Preparation for Pregnancy (LIPP),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03146156,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Studies evaluating lifestyle intervention in obese women during pregnancy have reported limited success in decreasing excessive gestational weight gain, and have failed to achieve the key outcome of breaking the obesity cycle and reducing neonatal adiposity or birth weight. Although some investigators advocate weight loss during pregnancy in obese women, these recommendations were based on extrapolation of retrospective epidemiological data. Of concern, we reported increased small for gestational age babies and decreased lean body mass in neonates of obese women with weight loss or inadequate gestational weight gain. Based on our research, optimal outcomes from lifestyle interventions are likely to be temporal and therefore must be initiated prior to conception to first improve maternal metabolic function, and subsequently, placental/fetal growth. Several large retrospective cohort studies support our hypothesis. For example, women who lost weight between pregnancies had fewer large for gestational age babies in contrast to women who increased interpregnancy weight. In addition, prospective randomized controlled trials have shown that postpartum weight loss is achievable without adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes, these studies include women who breastfed. Based on these observations, we propose a randomized control trial to determine the effect of lifestyle intervention initiated prior to a planned pregnancy on improving neonatal metabolism and adiposity. Our overarching hypothesis is that the maternal pre-pregnancy metabolic condition determines the obesogenic in-utero environment, which affects programming of placental mitochondrial function and metabolic pathways, promoting lipid accumulation and neonatal adiposity. Our rationale is based on the need to establish the most effective time to introduce an intervention that will break the obesity cycle in mothers and their children. Understanding how pregravid metabolic conditioning improves maternal physiology, and cellular and molecular function in pregnancy will provide the empirical data to support the intervention. We have a highly successful record of recruiting women who are planning a pregnancy, obtaining compliance in longitudinal studies, and in long-term follow-up of mothers and their offspring. Lifestyle intervention will be initiated prior to conception to decrease maternal body fat, inflammation, insulin resistance, and ?-cell dysfunction. Our transdisciplinary team has the required expertise in lifestyle interventions management of obesity, and in human physiology that is needed to determine the effects of these interventions on maternal metabolism and fetalplacental growth and function. We will recruit 200 women to pursue the following specific aims:

Specific Aim 1: To investigate the physiological significance of lifestyle intervention in preparation for pregnancy (LIPP) on maternal and neonatal metabolism and adiposity.

Specific Aim 2: To determine the molecular effects whereby lifestyle intervention initiated before pregnancy can improve placental mitochondrial lipid oxidation and accumulation.",NO,"Obesity|Lifestyle-related Condition|Macrosomia, Fetal",BEHAVIORAL: Lifestyle Intervention,"Neonatal adiposity comparison between intervention and usual care group, Neonatal anthropometry and air densitometry (pea pod), 48 to 72 hours after delivery","Maternal metabolic status, body composition, insulin sensitivity and insulin response, from baseline to 6 month post-partum and then during pregnancy at 12 to 16 weeks gestation and 34 to 36 weeks gestation.",,Tufts Medical Center,Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)|Pennington Biomedical Research Center|The Cleveland Clinic|MetroHealth Medical Center|Brigham and Women's Hospital,FEMALE,ADULT,NA,200,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION,IRB16-00553|R01HD088061,2017-03-21,2024-12-01,2024-12-01,2017-05-09,,2024-02-06,"Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 70808, United States|Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, 02111, United States|Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, United States|MetroHealth Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, 44109, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/56/NCT03146156/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"
NCT02688218,Exercise Detection Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02688218,,COMPLETED,"The risk of hypoglycemia in individuals with type 1 diabetes increases considerably during exercise. As a result, many patients with type 1 diabetes experience fear of and reluctance to pursue physical activity, in order to avoid the discomforting symptoms associated with hypoglycemia. The bi-hormonal artificial pancreas, a device used for automatic delivery of insulin and glucagon subcutaneously to subjects with type 1 diabetes, is paving the way to revolutionize the management of this disease. The investigator's group has recently completed a study of the bi-hormonal artificial pancreas system during exercise, suggesting reduced hypoglycemia around the exercise period. In order to prepare for a future home study, the ability to detect, grade, and classify physical activity so as to appropriately adjust system parameters is vital in helping to prevent exercise induced hypoglycemia in the home setting.

This study is designed to collect 3-axis accelerometry data and heart rate data during a variety of different home activities, as well as during formal exercise in both healthy subjects and subjects with type 1 diabetes.

NCT03917576,Heart Rate During Exercise in Type 2 Diabetes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03917576,HRinT2DM,COMPLETED,"Exercise training is a cornerstone for the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders and associated cardiometabolic complications such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and hypertension. Similar to the beneficial health effects after performing conventional continuous exercise modalities, high intensity interval training (HIIT) has been reported as an effective alternative exercise-modality to improve glucose homeostasis in both prediabetes subjects and individuals with T2D diagnosed. In this regard, although multiple HIIT-based interventions commonly report acute and long term benefits on body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness and insulin sensitivity in metabolically compromised subjects, little is known about the acute cardiovascular response (i.e., at heart rate level) during HIIT in subjects with different glucose control.

HIIT is described as performing brief periods of exercise at vigorous or maximal intensity, interspersed with inactive or low intensity recovery phases of variable duration. In order to characterize different HIIT-based protocols, exercise intensity is usually defined as relative percentages of individual maximal cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) or relative maximal power output values. Nevertheless, the need for specific technological equipment to assess these parameters usually limit the prescription and recommendations of HIIT in clinical settings and other public health contexts at massive level. Additionally, the use of self-perceived exertion scales and heart rate (HR) variations upon HIIT have been demonstrating to be accessible and feasible strategies to regulate exercise intensity during HIIT. For example, it was reported that HR and self-perceived exertion scores increased progressively in T2D subjects, parallel to the oxygen consumption rate throughout an acute HIIT session performed on cycle ergometer. Consequently, it is conceivable to hypothesize that determining HR variations during HIIT might optimize the recommendation of this training methodology in metabolically compromised subjects as those at risk or with T2D diagnosed. Therefore, the aim of the present study was To describe and compare the acute heart rate changes in response to an incremental maximal exercise test and a single HIIT session between normoglycaemic (NG), prediabetes (Pre-T2D) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) subjects.",NO,Type2 Diabetes Mellitus|Hyperglycemia|Heart Rate|Exercise Training,OTHER: Behavioral|OTHER: Exercise training intervention,"Maximum heart rate, Measured before and after 12 weeks of high-intensity interval training, 12 weeks","Resting heart rate, Measured before and after 12 weeks of high-intensity interval training, 12 weeks|Heart rate pre each HIIT-interval, Measured before and after 12 weeks of high-intensity interval training, 12 weeks|Heart rate post each HIIT-interval, Measured before and after 12 weeks of high-intensity interval training, 12 weeks",,Universidad de Los Lagos,Universidad de La Frontera,FEMALE,ADULT,NA,75,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION,RP010317,2018-01-04,2018-04-04,2018-04-07,2019-04-17,,2019-04-17,"Cristian ALvarez, Osorno, 5290000, Chile","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/76/NCT03917576/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"

Specifically, among AI, adults age 18 and over in the IHS Albuquerque Service Area, 51% have a BMI \> 30, which significantly exceeds the rate of obesity observed nationally (35.3%) and the Healthy People 2020 target of 30.5%. Likewise, the rate of T2D (22.8%) among the adult AI population in our Albuquerque service area is almost double the rate of the U.S. adult population (12.2%), and the age-adjusted diabetes mortality rate for AIs was 104.7 per 100,000 compared to 23.1 per 100,000 among non-Hispanic Whites in the region. At the same time, the median age of diagnosis of T2D among AI adults was much younger (42.2 years) than the national average (53.8 years).

Our major goal of implementing educational interventions to slow the current rate of increase in diabetes in Native communities is aligned with NIH's (NIGMS) and NM INBRE's vision in reducing health disparity using innovative interventions. The investigators propose following aims:

Aim 1: Recruit and Screen 300 community members in Acoma Pueblo, NM to identify incident cases of pre-diabetes for the proposed study of Home Based Diabetes Care (HBDC);

Aim 2: Enroll 150 Acoma Natives aged 21-70 years, at risk for T2D (i.e., overweight, obese, and/or with at least one affected first degree relative or a history of gestational DM) and conduct HBDC for a 16-week lifestyle intervention in a longitudinal cohort study.
