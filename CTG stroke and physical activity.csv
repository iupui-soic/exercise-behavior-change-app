It quantitatively measures impairment based on Twitchell and Brunnstrom's concept of sequential stages of motor return in hemiplegic stroke patients. It uses an ordinal scale for scoring of 33 items for the upper limb component of the F-M scale (0:can not perform; 1:can perform partially; 2:can perform fully). Total range is 0-66, 0 being poor and 66 normal., Baseline, immediately after end of treatment (within a week), 2 weeks after end of treatment, 12 weeks after end of treatment|Neural Activity (Cortical Dynamics) Measured by Electroencephalography (EEG) Movement-related Cortical Potential (MRCP) Amplitude, EEG activity in the low-frequency delta band will be assessed. Scalp EEG electrodes will be located over the motor cortex, specifically, central (Cz, C1- C4), fronto- central (FCz, FC1 - FC4) and centro-parietal electrodes (CPz, CP1 - CP4). Further, to account for left hand vs. right hand impairment, the electrode locations will be flipped for individuals with right hand impairment. Increased MRCP amplitude indicates increased activation of the ipsi-lesional hemisphere or inhibition of competing contra-lesional hemisphere, following motor relearning., Baseline, immediately after end of treatment (within a week)|Cortical Dynamics Measured by Electroencephalography (EEG) Movement-related Cortical Potential (MRCP) Latency, EEG activity in the low-frequency delta band will be assessed.

NCT04919161,Explorations of the Benefits of the ZeroG TRiP System to Improve Balance in Patients Following Stroke,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04919161,,COMPLETED,"Strokes are neurological events that can lead to devastating physical and cognitive deficits, such as the inability to ambulate, impaired balance regulation, and loss of coordination. Due to the physical and cognitive deficits experienced following a stroke, many require admission to an inpatient rehabilitation facility to maximize their independence before returning to the home setting. The ability to walk, stand, climb stairs, and other mobility-related functional tasks, are critical components of achieving this functional independence. However, it is often difficult for post-stroke patients with balance impairments to safely practice balance and gait training without putting both therapists and patients at risk for injury. Incorporating robotic technologies to neurological rehabilitation can play a critical role in delivering safe and effective gait and balance therapy.

Body-weight support systems (BWSSs) unload paretic lower limbs, patients with gait impairments can practice a higher repetition of steps in a safe, controlled manner. As participants perform gait training, these systems support the participant's body-weight, permitting those with excessive weakness and poor coordination, to ambulate and perform more intensive therapy sessions sooner in their recovery, with minimal risk injurious fall. In addition to BWSSs, balance perturbation systems, which purposefully unbalance participants so to rehabilitate their postural control, have been used to improve gait and balance-control after stroke, or other age and disease related balance impairments.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a recently developed, not yet reported, balance perturbation module for the ZeroG BWSS. This new balance perturbation training module is directly integrated into the ZeroG BWSS and allows for the direct induction of safe lateral, anterior, and/or posterior perturbations via a Wi-Fi-enabled handheld device. During both stationary and ambulatory activities, this system was used unbalance participants in order to train their balance-control and balance-reactions. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine if this newly developed BWSS balance perturbation system more effectively rehabilitates participant gait and balance after stroke than the standard BWSS protocol without perturbations.",YES,Stroke|Balance; Distorted,DEVICE: Body weight support system control group|DEVICE: Body weight support system with balance perturbations,"Difference in Berg Balance Scale Pre-intervention and Post-intervention Assessment Scores, The Berg Balance Scale is a standardized objective measure of a subject/participant's balance.

NCT01600131,RESCUE Stroke Caregiver Website to Enhance Discharge Planning,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01600131,RESCUE,COMPLETED,"Aims and Intervention:

The long-term goal is to implement stroke caregiver programs that involve low-cost interventions that are sustainable in routine clinical practice. The immediate objective is to test, using a randomized controlled trial, a problem-solving intervention for stroke caregivers that can be delivered during the transitional care period (e.g., time which Veteran is discharged to home) followed by online, in-home sessions. The investigators will modify the traditional, problem-solving intervention by adding web-based training using interactive modules, factsheets, and tools on previously developed and nationally available RESCUE Caregiver website (www.cidrr8.research.va.gov/rescue). The investigators will also provide on-line, skills training and application of the problem-solving approach via the RESCUE messaging center. The immediate, primary aim (#1) is to test the effect of the intervention on stroke caregivers' depressive symptoms at 11 and 19 weeks after baseline data collection. Aim #2 is to test the effect of the intervention on stroke caregivers' burden, positive aspects of caregiving, self-efficacy, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and satisfaction with care at 11 and 19 weeks after baseline data collection. Aim #3 is to test the effect of the intervention on Veterans' outcomes: functional abilities and healthcare utilization (i.e., unintended hospital bed days of care, number of emergency room visits, number of unscheduled clinic visits) at 11 and 19 weeks after baseline data collection. Aim #4 is to determine the budgetary impact for implementing the intervention. Aim #5 is to determine the facilitators, barriers and best practices for implementing the intervention.

Design and Methods:

The investigators will conduct a two-group randomized controlled trial. The investigators will enroll 240 stroke caregivers at 8 study sites (North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Healthcare System, Miami VA Healthcare System, James A. Haley Veterans Hospital in Tampa, Michael E. Debakey VAMC in Houston, Hunter Holmes McGuire VAMC in Richmond, Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System, VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, and the VA Boston Healthcare System). Eligible caregivers will be interviewed, complete baseline measures, and then be randomized to two groups: 1) intervention group, or 2) standard care. A team member will telephone caregivers at 11 weeks and 19 weeks after baseline data collection to answer questions on instruments with established reliability and validity. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with selected caregivers to obtain in-depth perceptions of the value, facilitators, and barriers of the intervention.

Impact:

This is the first known study to test a transition-to-home intervention combined with technology to improve the quality of caregiving and the recovery of Veterans.",YES,Depression|Quality of Life|Self Efficacy|Recovery of Function|Stress|Positive Aspects of Caregiving,BEHAVIORAL: Caregiver problem-solving|OTHER: Standard Care,"Change in Depressive Symptoms at 11 Weeks, Changes in depressive symptoms will be measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale.

At least 20% of strokes occur during sleep, so- called 'wake up stroke'. Thrombolysis with the clot-busting drug alteplase is effective for acute ischaemic stroke, provided that it is given within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Patients with wake-up stroke are currently ineligible for clot-busting therapy. Previous studies indicate that many wake-up strokes occur just before awakening.

In this study, patients with wake-up stroke will be randomized to thrombolysis with tenecteplase and best standard treatment or to best standard treatment without thrombolysis. Tenecteplase has several potential advantages over alteplase, including very rapid action and that it can be given as a single injection. Prior to thrombolysis, a brain scan must be done to exclude bleeding or significant brain damage as a result from the stroke. We will use a CT scan to inform this decision.

NCT04437251,Effect of Brain Stimulation on Stepping Performance in Stroke Survivors and Healthy Adults,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04437251,Gait,RECRUITING,"Participants are being asked to participate in a research study conducted by Shih-Chiao Tseng, PT, Ph.D. at Texas Woman's University. This research study is to determine whether low-intensive brain stimulation can enhance learning of a leg movement task. The investigators also want to know if brain stimulation can improve the nerve function and walking performance. Our goal is to understand any relationship between brain stimulation and overall movement control improvement. Participants have been invited to join this research if they have had a stroke before or they are healthy adults aged 21 years or older. Research evidence shows stroke can induce permanent brain damage and therefore may cause a person to have trouble learning a new task. This in turn may significantly impact the recovery of motor function in stroke survivors. In addition, the investigators also want to know how a healthy person learns this new leg task and see if her/his learning pattern differs from a stroke survivor.

This study comprises two phases: Phase I study investigates short-term effects of brain stimulation on leg skill learning and only requires two visits to TWU. The total time commitment for Phase I study will be about 6.5 hours, 3.5 hours on the first visit and three hours on the second visit; Phase II study is an expanded version of Phase I study to investigate long-term effects of brain stimulation on leg skill learning and requires to complete 12 visits of exercise training paired with brain stimulation over a four-week period and additional one visit for follow-up test. The total time commitment for Phase II study will be about 20 hours, a total of 18 hours for 12 exercise training sessions and two hours for a follow-up test. The investigators hypothesize that people with chronic stroke will show a slower rate of acquiring this leg skill as compared to healthy adults.

NCT05436366,Soleus Loading Response During Walking,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05436366,,RECRUITING,"Stroke survivors experience motor deficits, weak voluntary muscle activations, and low weight-bearing capacity that impair ambulation. Restoring motor function is a priority for people post-stroke, whose gait patterns are slow, and metabolically inefficient. The role of the ankle is crucial for locomotion because it stores mechanical energy throughout the stance phase, leading to a large activation of plantarflexor muscles during push-off for propulsion.

After a stroke, paretic plantarflexors undergo changes in their mechanics and activation patterns that yield diminished ankle power, propulsion, and gait speed. Recovery of lost plantarflexor function can increase propulsion and mitigate unnatural gait compensations that occur during hemiparetic walking.

In the stance phase, dorsiflexion is imposed at the ankle and the plantarflexors are loaded, which results in excitation of group Ia and II afferents, and group Ib afferents. Load sensing Ib afferents are active in mid-late stance, and through spinal excitatory pathways, reinforces the activation of plantarflexors and propulsive force generation at the ankle. Targeting the excitability of the load sensitive Ib excitatory pathway, propulsive soleus activity and resulting force generation (and thereby gait speed) can be improved after stroke.

The long-term research goal is to develop a novel hybrid gait paradigm integrating operant conditioning and powered wearable devices to advance neuro-behavioral training and enhance locomotor ability after stroke. The overall objectives are to 1) modulate the soleus muscle loading response within the stance phase, and 2) develop a dynamic protocol to operantly condition the soleus response in stroke survivors. The central hypothesis is that enhancing the soleus loading response in mid-late stance phase through operant up-conditioning can increase plantarflexor power and forward propulsion after stroke.

In working towards attaining the research objective and testing the central hypothesis, the objective of this pilot study is to modulate the soleus loading response in the stance phase during treadmill walking. The specific aims in this study are to 1) apply ankle perturbations in mid-late stance phase combining a control algorithm and a powered device to characterize the changes in soleus EMG between perturbed and unperturbed (i.e., when no perturbations are applied) step cycles in 15 able-bodied individuals; and 2) determine the feasibility of the wearable ankle device and its algorithm in 5 participants with hemiparesis and gait deficits due to a stroke. The testing of the device and its algorithm will provide foundational evidence to adjust the soleus stimuli continuously and reliably, and develop the new walking operant conditioning protocol for stroke survivors.

An expected outcome in this pilot is to lay the groundwork to develop the soleus up-conditioning protocol as a potential strategy to improve paretic leg function. If successfully developed, this new protocol proposed in a subsequent study will be the first neurobehavioral training method that targets spinal load-sensitive pathways to improve ankle plantarflexor power and forward propulsion after stroke.",NO,Healthy|Spastic Hemiparesis|Stroke,DEVICE: Soleus loading response in able-bodied participants|DEVICE: Soleus loading response in participants with hemiparesis,"Change in soleus EMG response, Changes in the soleus EMG response is the primary measure, which is the difference between the non-perturbed and perturbed EMG (i.e., the difference between the EMG obtained during step cycles with and without the applied ankle joint perturbation)., From enrollment to end of intervention at approximately 1 week",,,Victor H.

NCT05447884,Improving Balance and Energetics of Walking Using a Hip Exoskeleton,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05447884,,RECRUITING,"Robotic lower limb exoskeletons aim to improve or augment limb functions. Automatic modulation of robotic assistance is very important because it can increase the assistive outcomes and guarantee safety when using exoskeletons.

However, this automatic assistance adjustment is challenging due to person-to-person and day-to-day variations, as well as the time-varying complex human-machine-interaction forces. In recent years, human-in-the-loop optimization methods have been investigated to reduce participants' metabolic costs by providing personalized assistance from robotic exoskeletons. However, metabolic cost measure is noisy and the experimental protocol is usually relatively long. In addition, the influence of exoskeleton control on this human state in terms of energetic cost is unclear and indirect. More importantly, the optimization by reducing metabolic cost is found to affect human gait patterns and cause undesired outcomes. In this study, new evaluation measures other than metabolic cost will be investigated to optimize the assistance from a powered hip exoskeleton based on a reinforcement learning method. It is hypothesized that the new reinforcement learning-based optimal control approach will produce personalized torque assistance, reduce human volitional effort, and improve balance and other performance during walking tasks.

NCT05330234,Usability Study of OnTrack Tools,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05330234,,COMPLETED,"Aims: Assess the usability of OnTrack Tools, a clinician facing interface to manage stroke survivors using the OnTrack rehabilitation system. Background: Arm disability is a common problem after stroke that can lead to loss of independence, it affects

\~450,000 people in the UK. Repetitive activity is critical for recovery but research shows people can struggle with intensity and keeping track of progress. The OnTrack system being developed at Imperial College London is a potential solution to this problem. Intervention: The OnTrack system consists of two software applications, OnTrack App - used by patients, and OnTrack Tools - used by clinicians. OnTrack Tools pulls data generated by the OnTrack App and enables the monitoring of clients' arm activity, and management of goals and educational content. The software is used to inform selfmanagement coaching by helping therapists understand more about how and when patients use their affected arm between treatment sessions. Design and methods: This study will assess the usability of the OnTrack Tools component of the system. The study will recruit stroke therapists from Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust to provide feedback on the experience and usability of OnTrack Tools' graphical user interface (GUI). The study will be divided into three progressive cycles of testing, feedback and iteration. Each cycle will see participants individually completing specific tasks related to system navigation and the management of patients under simulation. Participants will complete outcome measures and take part in focus groups. Researchers will analyse and use the feedback to improve the GUI ready for the next testing cycle. Patient and public involvement: The project team includes a PPIE group of stroke survivors who oversee the project and help us with public facing documentation. They are members of the research team and are reimbursed for their time and travel, according to INVOLVE guidance. Dissemination: Results of the study will be written-up for technical reporting and publication. Participants will be provided with a summary of results at the end of the study.

NCT02856035,Novel Brain Signal Feedback Paradigm to Enhance Motor Learning After Stroke,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02856035,,COMPLETED,"Stroke (795,000/year in the US and 30 million existing stroke survivors in the world) damages brain neural structures that control coordinated upper limb movement. To most effectively target the brain damage, interventions should be directed so as to restore brain control serving coordination of peripheral neuromuscular function. Currently, there is a lack of a transformative intervention strategy, and only limited efficacy is seen in response to neural rehabilitation that is only peripherally-directed (limbs e.g.) or only directed at the brain. This study will employ a novel neural feedback approach with a closed-loop, real-time paradigm to engage and retrain existing brain function after stroke. Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMIR) provides neural feedback with the advantage of precisely identifying the location of brain activity for multiple cognitive and emotional tasks. However, the rtfMRI is costly and precludes motor learning that requires sitting and engaging the upper limb in complex motor tasks during imaging acquisition. In contrast, real-time functional near-infrared spectroscopy (rtfNIRS), although not as spatially precise as rtfMRI, offers a low-cost, portable solution to provide brain neural feedback during motor learning. This proposal will utilize both technologies in a hybrid, sequential motor learning protocol. Moreover, the study protocol will also simultaneously involve both central effective signals (through neural feedback) and peripheral affective signals by employing neutrally-triggered functional electrical stimulation (FES)-assisted coordination practice, which produces peripherally-induced affective signals from muscle and joint receptors. This novel combination intervention protocol will engage the central nervous system, motor effective pathway training along with induction of affective signal production (FES-assisted practice), all of which will be implemented within the framework of evidence-based motor learning principles.",YES,Stroke,OTHER: Neural feedback plus FES and motor training,"Arm Motor Abilities Test Functional Domain (AMAT - F), AMAT-F is a measure of 13 complex, coordinated tasks used in everyday living: functional normality of movement during the 13 tasks.
