NCT03406767,A Comparison Between GLA:D Canada and an Individualized JointEffort Exercise Program in Knee Osteoarthritis Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03406767,,COMPLETED,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide and affects more than 4.4 million people in Canada (13% of Canadians). OA symptoms include joint pain, stiffness, range of motion loss, and inflammation, resulting in a significant decrease in quality of life. Current evidence-based guidelines for OA management recommend weight loss, patient education, exercise therapy, bracing, viscosupplementation, and anti-inflammatory/pain medications prior to joint replacement surgery. Unfortunately, current practice trends are not consistent with these guidelines and focus largely on joint replacement. Recently, research from a group in Denmark has shown a reduction in the progression of knee OA symptoms, joint related painkiller use, individuals on sick leave, and higher physical activity levels 12 months after a combined patient education and standardized group exercise therapy program (GLA:D®). Based on the Danish success, the GLA:D® program has been made available in Canada. To date it is unclear if the GLA:DTM Canada program will result in outcomes similar to those seen in Denmark, or how the GLA:DTM program compares to existing individualized OA care programs (i.e. JointEffort). This research will answer the following three questions;

1. Is the GLA:DTM standardized education and exercise program associated with improvements in functional mobility, quality of life, pain management, and inflammatory biomarkers in knee OA patients in Calgary, Alberta?
2. Is the JointEffort individualized exercise and education program associated with improved functional mobility, quality of life, pain management, and inflammatory biomarkers in knee OA patients in Calgary, Alberta?

NCT05548712,The Effect of PEMF for Patients With Knee OA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05548712,,RECRUITING,"Health care costs are increasing alarmingly, which will impose an overwhelming economic burden to an aging society like that of Hong Kong. For example, degenerative musculoskeletal disorders such as osteoarthritis (OA) present a grand challenge with its high prevalence (\>40% in the elderly suffered from knee OA). OA is a debilitating progressive disease with typical symptoms such as acute pain causing loss of mobility Currently there is no cure for OA. Pharmacological treatment and new regenerative technologies such as stem cell therapy are actively being developed, but most of these options are very expensive per se, and side effects are not uncommon. Costeffectiveness is also a major consideration for devising new therapeutic modalities for OA.

There are emerging evidences showing that pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) can modulae mitochondrial activities for muscle gain. PEMF exposure on top of regular exercise training may promote muscle regeneration and tissue healing.

This study aims to conduct a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of PEMF treatment on knee pain in patients with knee OA. We hypothesize that PEMF treatment is effective to relief in pain and improve knee function in Knee OA subjects.

Based on the aim of this study, older adult patients (aged 50 or above) with knee OA with Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2-4 by X-ray, have sedentary lifestyle (Tegner activity level less or equal to 3), no acute knee injuries in past 12 months, no muscle strain in past 12 months and not degenerative joint disease in other joints except the involved knee.

With an increasing number of Partial or Total Knee Arthroplasty performed in a population that is aging during a time where the amount of healthcare dollars allotted to rehabilitation is declining, there is a need to develop remote monitoring of rehabilitation and to engage and optimize self-management of recovery.

Current management of Partial or Total Knee Arthroplasty recovery is typically performed in the out-patient setting and is highly protocol driven. A typical case might be seen by the physical therapist 2-3x/week for 8-10 weeks to perform specific exercises and to monitor progress (i.e. compliance with ROM and strengthening exercises). One recent study suggested that variation in patients' independent exercise and activity after arthroplasty surgery may contribute to variable functional gains.

Kinematic (joint angle) and kinetic (joint loading) data will be collected synchronously using high-speed digital cameras and treadmill-embedded force platforms., Baseline, 12 weeks|Change from Baseline to 12 weeks in knee symptoms: Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Validated questionnaire on symptoms and functional limitations related to knee osteoarthritis. The score is expressed in percentage (0-100), with 0 representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems., Baseline, 12 weeks|Change from Baseline to 12 weeks in knee symptoms: Visual Analog Scale, Knee pain during and after running will be assessed for each training. The minimum value is ""No Pain"" and the maximum value is ""Worst Pain Imaginable"".
